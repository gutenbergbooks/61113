<span class="small">THE NATURAL HISTORY OF GRAIN.</span></h2></div>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)—TASTE OF THE ANCIENTS FOR AGRICULTURE.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> now pass on to the Natural History of the various grains,
of the garden plants and flowers, and indeed of all the other
productions, with the exception of the trees and shrubs, which
the Earth, in her bounteousness, affords us—a boundless field
for contemplation, if even we regard the herbs alone, when we
take into consideration the varieties of them, their numbers,
the flowers they produce, their odours, their colours, their
juices, and the numerous properties they possess—all of which
have been engendered by her with a view to either the preservation
or the gratification of the human race.</p>

<p>On entering, however, upon this branch of my subject, it is
my wish in the first place to plead the cause of the Earth, and
to act as the advocate of her who is the common parent of all,
although in the earlier<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> part of this work I have already had
occasion to speak in her defence. For my subject matter, as I
proceed in the fulfilment of my task, will now lead me to consider
her in the light of being the producer of various noxious
substances as well; in consequence of which it is that we are
in the habit of charging her with our crimes, and imputing to
her a guilt that is our own. She has produced poisons, it is
true; but who is it but man that has found them out? For
the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, it is sufficient to
be on their guard against them, and to keep at a distance from
them. The elephant, we find, and the urus, know how to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
sharpen<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and renovate their teeth against the trunks of trees,
and the rhinoceros against rocks; wild boars, again, point
their tusks like so many poniards by the aid of both rocks and
trees; and all animals, in fact, are aware how to prepare themselves
for the infliction of injury upon others; but still, which
is there among them all, with the exception of man, that dips
his weapons in poison? As for ourselves, we envenom the
point of the arrow,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and we contrive to add to the destructive
powers of iron itself; by the aid of poisons we taint the waters
of the stream, and we infect the various elements of Nature;
indeed, the very air even, which is the main support of life,
we turn into a medium for the destruction of life.</p>

<p>And it is not that we are to suppose that animals are ignorant
of these means of defence, for we have already had occasion
to point out<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> the preparations which they make against the
attacks of the serpent, and the methods they devise for effecting
a cure when wounded by it; and yet, among them all, there
is not one that fights by the aid of the poison that belongs to
another, with the sole exception of man. Let us then candidly
confess our guilt, we who are not contented even with the
poisons as Nature has produced them; for by far the greater
portion of them, in fact, are artificially prepared by the human
hand!</p>

<p>And then besides, is it not the fact, that there are many
men, the very existence of whom is a baneful poison, as it
were? Like that of the serpent, they dart their livid tongue,
and the venom of their disposition corrodes every object upon
which it concentrates itself. Ever vilifying and maligning,
like the ill-omened birds of the night, they disturb the repose
of that darkness which is so peculiarly their own, and break
in upon the quiet of the night even, by their moans and wailings,
the only sounds they are ever heard to emit. Like
animals of inauspicious presage, they only cross our path to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
prevent us from employing our energies or becoming useful to
our fellow-men; and the only enjoyment that is sought by
their abominable aspirations is centred in their universal hatred
of mankind.</p>

<p>Still, however, even in this respect Nature has asserted her
majestic sway; for how much more numerous<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> are the good
and estimable characters which she has produced! just in the
same proportion that we find her giving birth to productions
which are at once both salutary and nutritious to man. It is in
our high esteem for men such as these, and the commendations
they bestow, that we shall be content to leave the others, like
so many brakes and brambles, to the devouring flames of their
own bad passions, and to persist in promoting the welfare of
the human race; and this, with all the more energy and perseverance,
from the circumstance that it has been our object
throughout, rather to produce a work of lasting utility than to
ensure ourselves a widely-spread renown. We have only to
speak, it is true, of the fields and of rustic operations; but
still, it is upon these that the enjoyment of life so materially
depends, and that the ancients conferred the very highest rank
in their honours and commendations.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2. (2.)—WHEN THE FIRST WREATHS OF CORN WERE USED
AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>Romulus was the first who established the Arval<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> priesthood
at Rome. This order consisted of the eleven sons of Acca
Larentia, his nurse,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> together with Romulus himself, who assumed
the appellation of the twelfth of the brotherhood. Upon
this priesthood he bestowed, as being the most august distinction
that he could confer upon it, a wreath of ears of corn,
tied together with a white fillet; and this, in fact, was the
first chaplet that was ever used at Rome. This dignity is only
ended with life itself, and whether in exile or in captivity, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
always attends its owner. In those early days, two jugera of
land were considered enough for a citizen of Rome, and to none
was a larger portion than this allotted. And yet, at the present
day, men who but lately were the slaves of the Emperor Nero
have been hardly content with pleasure-gardens that occupied
the same space as this; while they must have fishponds, forsooth,
of still greater extent, and in some instances I might
add, perhaps, kitchens even as well.</p>

<p>Numa first established the custom of offering corn to the
gods, and of propitiating them with the salted<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> cake; he was
the first, too, as we learn from Hemina, to parch spelt, from
the fact that, when in this state, it is more wholesome as an
aliment.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> This method, however, he could only establish one
way: by making an enactment, to the effect that spelt is not
in a pure state for offering, except when parched. He it was,
too, who instituted the Fornacalia,<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> festivals appropriated
for the parching of corn, and others,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> observed with equal
solemnity, for the erection and preservation of the “termini,”
or boundaries of the fields: for these termini, in those days,
they particularly regarded as gods; while to other divinities
they gave the names of Seia,<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> from “sero,” “to sow,” and of
Segesta, from the “segetes,” or “crops of standing corn,” the
statues of which goddesses we still see erected in the Circus.
A third divinity it is forbidden by the rules of our religion to
name even<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> beneath a roof. In former days, too, they would
not so much as taste the corn when newly cut, nor yet wine
when just made, before the priests had made a libation of the
first-fruits.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 3. (3.)—THE JUGERUM OF LAND.</span></h3></div>

<p>That portion of land used to be known as a “jugerum,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
which was capable of being ploughed by a single “jugum,” or
yoke of oxen, in one day; an “actus”<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> being as much as the
oxen could plough at a single spell, fairly estimated, without
stopping. This last was one hundred and twenty feet in length;
and two in length made a jugerum. The most considerable
recompense that could be bestowed upon generals and valiant
citizens, was the utmost extent of land around which a person
could trace a furrow with the plough in a single day. The
whole population, too, used to contribute a quarter<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> of a sextarius
of spelt, or else half a one, per head.</p>

<p>From agriculture the earliest surnames were derived. Thus,
for instance, the name of Pilumnus was given to him who invented
the “pilum,” or pestle of the bake-house, for pounding
corn; that of Piso was derived from “piso,” to grind corn;
and those of Fabius, Lentulus, and Cicero, from the several
varieties<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> of leguminous plants in the cultivation of which respectively
these individuals excelled. One individual of the
family of the Junii received the name of “Bubulcus,”<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> from
the skill he displayed in breeding oxen. Among the sacred
ceremonials, too, there was nothing that was held more holy
than the marriage by confarreation,<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and the woman just
married used to present a cake made of spelt.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Careless cultivation
of the land was in those times an offence that came
under the cognizance of the censors; and, as we learn from
Cato,<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> when it was said that such and such a man was a good
agriculturist or a good husbandman, it was looked upon as the
very highest compliment that could be paid him. A man
came to be called “locuples,” or “rich,” from being “loci
plenus,” or “full of earth.” Money, too, received its name
of “pecunia,”<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> from “pecus,” “cattle.” At the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
day, even, in the registers of the censors, we find set down
under the head of “pascua,” or “pasture lands,” everything
from which the public revenues are derived, from the fact that
for a long period of time pasture lands were the only sources
of the public revenue. Fines, too, were only imposed in the
shape of paying so many sheep or so many oxen; and the benevolent
spirit of the ancient laws deserves remark, which
most considerately enjoined that the magistrate, when he indicted
a penalty, should never impose a fine of an ox before
having first condemned the same party to the payment of a
sheep.</p>

<p>Those who celebrated the public games in honour of the ox
received the name of Bubetii.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> King Servius was the first
who impressed upon our copper coin<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> the figures of sheep and
oxen. To depasture cattle secretly by night upon the unripe
crops on plough lands, or to cut them in that state, was made
by the Twelve Tables<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> a capital offence in the case of an
adult; and it was enacted that the person guilty of it should
be hanged, in order to make due reparation to the goddess
Ceres, a punishment more severe, even, than that inflicted for
murder. If, on the other hand, the offender was not an adult,
he was beaten at the discretion of the pr&aelig;tor; a penalty double
the amount of the damage was also exacted.</p>

<p>The various ranks, too, and distinctions in the state had no
other origin than the pursuits of agriculture. The rural
tribes held the foremost rank, and were composed of those
who possessed lands; while those of the city, a place to which
it was looked upon as ignominious to be transferred, had the
discredit thrown upon them of being an indolent race. Hence
it was that these last were only four in number, and received
their names from the several parts of the City which they respectively
inhabited; being the Suburran, the Palatine, Colline,
and Exquiline tribes. Every ninth day<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> the rural tribes
used to visit the city for the purpose of marketing, and it was
for this reason that it was made illegal to hold the comitia upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the Nundin&aelig;; the object being that the country people might
not be called away thereby from the transaction of their business.
In those days repose and sleep were enjoyed upon
straw. Even to glory itself, in compliment to corn, the name
was given of “adorea.”<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>For my own part, I greatly admire<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> the modes of expression
employed in our ancient language: thus, for instance,
we read in the Commentaries of the Priesthood to the following
effect:—“For deriving an augury from the sacrifice of a
bitch,<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> a day should be set apart before the ear of corn appears
from out of the sheath,<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and then again before it enters the
sheath.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 4.—HOW OFTEN AND ON WHAT OCCASIONS CORN HAS SOLD
AT A REMARKABLY LOW PRICE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The consequence was, that when the Roman manners were
such as these, the corn that Italy produced was sufficient for
its wants, and it had to be indebted to no province for its
food; and not only this, but the price of provisions was incredibly
cheap. Manius Marcius, the &aelig;dile<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> of the people,
was the first who gave corn to the people at the price of one
as for the modius. L. Minutius Augurinus,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> the same who
detected, when eleventh tribune of the people, the projects of
Spurius M&aelig;lius, reduced the price of corn on three market
days,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> to one as per modius; for which reason a statue was
erected in honour of him, by public subscription, without the
Trigeminian Gate.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> T. Seius distributed corn to the people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
in his &aelig;dileship,<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> at one as per modius, in remembrance of
which statues were erected in honour of him also in the Capitol
and the Palatium: on the day of his funeral he was borne to
the pile on the shoulders of the Roman people. In the year,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
too, in which the Mother of the Gods was brought to Rome, the
harvest of that summer, it is said, was more abundant than it
had been for ten years before. M. Varro informs us, that in the
year<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> in which L. Metellus exhibited so many elephants in
his triumphal procession, a modius of spelt was sold for one as,
which was the standard price also of a congius of wine, thirty
pounds’ weight of dried figs, ten pounds of olive oil, and
twelve pounds of flesh meat. Nor did this cheapness originate
in the wide-spread domains of individuals encroaching continually
upon their neighbours, for by a law proposed by Licinius
Stolo, the landed property of each individual was limited
to five hundred jugera; and he himself was convicted under
his own law of being the owner of more than that amount,
having as a disguise prevailed upon his son to lend him his
name. Such were the prices of commodities at a time when
the fortunes of the republic were rapidly on the increase. The
words, too, that were uttered by Manius Curius<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> after his
triumphs and the addition of an immense extent of territory
to the Roman sway, are well known: “The man must be
looked upon,” said he, “as a dangerous citizen, for whom
seven jugera of land are not enough;” such being the amount
of land that had been allotted to the people after the expulsion
of the kings.</p>

<p>What, then, was the cause of a fertility so remarkable as
this? The fact, we have every reason to believe, that in
those days the lands were tilled by the hands of generals
even, the soil exulting beneath a plough-share crowned with
wreaths of laurel, and guided by a husbandman graced with
triumphs: whether it is that they tended the seed with the
same care that they had displayed in the conduct of wars, and
manifested the same diligent attention in the management of
their fields that they had done in the arrangement of the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
or whether it is that under the hands of honest men everything
prospers all the better, from being attended to with a
scrupulous exactness. The honours awarded to Serranus<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
found him engaged in sowing his fields, a circumstance to
which he owes his surname.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Cincinnatus was ploughing his
four jugera of land upon the Vaticanian Hill—the same that are
still known as the “Quintian Meadows,”<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> when the messenger
brought him the dictatorship—finding him, the tradition
says, stripped to the work, and his very face begrimed
with dust. “Put on your clothes,” said he, “that I may deliver
to you the mandates of the senate and people of Rome.”
In those days these messengers bore the name of “viator,” or
“wayfarer,” from the circumstance that their usual employment
was to fetch the senators and generals from their fields.</p>

<p>But at the present day these same lands are tilled by slaves
whose legs are in chains, by the hands of malefactors and men
with a branded face! And yet the Earth is not deaf to our
adjurations, when we address her by the name of “parent,”
and say that she receives our homage<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> in being tilled by
hands such as these; as though, forsooth, we ought not to believe
that she is reluctant and indignant at being tended in
such a manner as this! Indeed, ought we to feel any surprise
were the recompense she gives us when worked by chastised
slaves,<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> not the same that she used to bestow upon the labours
of warriors?</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 5.—ILLUSTRIOUS MEN WHO HAVE WRITTEN UPON AGRICULTURE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Hence it was that to give precepts upon agriculture became
one of the principal occupations among men of the highest
rank, and that in foreign nations even. For among those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
have written on this subject we find the names of kings even,
Hiero, for instance, Attalus Philometor, and Archela&uuml;s, as well as
of generals, Xenophon, for example, and Mago the Carthaginian.
Indeed, to this last writer did the Roman senate award such
high honours, that, after the capture of Carthage, when it
bestowed the libraries of that city upon the petty kings of
Africa, it gave orders, in his case only, that his thirty-two
Books should be translated into the Latin language, and this,
although M. Cato had already compiled his Book of Precepts;
it took every care also to entrust the execution of this task to
men who were well versed in the Carthaginian tongue, among
whom was pre-eminent D. Silanus, a member of one of the
most illustrious families of Rome. I have already indicated,<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
at the commencement of this work, the numerous learned
authors and writers in verse, together with other illustrious
men, whose authority it is my intention to follow; but among
the number I may here more particularly distinguish M. Varro,
who, at the advanced age of eighty-eight years, thought it
his duty to publish a treatise upon this subject.</p>

<p>(4.) Among the Romans the cultivation of the vine was
introduced at a comparatively recent period, and at first, as
indeed they were obliged to do, they paid their sole attention
to the culture of the fields. The various methods of cultivating
the land will now be our subject; and they shall be treated
of by us in no ordinary or superficial manner, but in the same
spirit in which we have hitherto written; enquiry shall be
made with every care first into the usages of ancient days, and
then into the discoveries of more recent times, our attention
being devoted alike to the primary causes of these operations,
and the reasons upon which they are respectively based. We
shall make mention,<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> too, of the various constellations, and of
the several indications which, beyond all doubt, they afford to
the earth; and the more so, from the fact that those writers
who have hitherto treated of them with any degree of exactness,
seem to have written their works for the use of any class
of men but the agriculturist.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 6.—POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN BUYING LAND.</span></h3></div>

<p>First of all, then, I shall proceed in a great measure according
to the dicta of the oracles of agriculture; for there is no
branch of practical life in which we find them more numerous
or more unerring. And why should we not view in the light
of oracles those precepts which have been tested by the infallibility
of time and the truthfulness of experience?</p>

<p>(5.) To make a beginning, then, with Cato<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>—“The agricultural
population,” says he, “produces the bravest men, the
most valiant soldiers,<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and a class of citizens the least given of
all to evil designs.—Do not be too eager in buying a farm.—In
rural operations never be sparing of your trouble, and, above
all, when you are purchasing land.—A bad bargain is always
a ground for repentance.—Those who are about to purchase
land, should always have an eye more particularly to the water
there, the roads, and the neighbourhood.” Each of these
points is susceptible of a very extended explanation, and
replete with undoubted truths. Cato<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> recommends, too, that
an eye should be given to the people in the neighbourhood, to
see how they look: “For where the land is good,” says he,
“the people will look well-conditioned and healthy.”</p>

<p>Atilius Regulus, the same who was twice consul in the
Punic War, used to say<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that a person should neither buy an
unhealthy piece of land in the most fertile locality, nor yet the
very healthiest spot if in a barren country. The salubrity of
land, however, is not always to be judged of from the looks of
the inhabitants, for those who are well-seasoned are able to
withstand the effects of living in pestilent localities even. And
then, besides, there are some localities that are healthy during
certain periods of the year only; though, in reality, there is
no soil that can be looked upon as really valuable that is not
healthy all the year through. “That<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> is sure to be bad land
against which its owner has a continual struggle.” Cato
recommends us before everything, to see that the land which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
we are about to purchase not only excels in the advantages of
locality, as already stated, but is really good of itself. We
should see, too, he says, that there is an abundance of manual
labour in the neighbourhood, as well as a thriving town; that
there are either rivers or roads, to facilitate the carriage of the
produce; that the buildings upon the land are substantially
erected, and that the land itself bears every mark of having
been carefully tilled—a point upon which I find that many
persons are greatly mistaken, as they are apt to imagine that
the negligence of the previous owner is greatly to the purchaser’s
advantage; while the fact is, that there is nothing more
expensive than the cultivation of a neglected soil.</p>

<p>For this reason it is that Cato<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> says that it is best to buy
land of a careful proprietor, and that the methods adopted by
others ought not to be hastily rejected—that it is the same
with land as with mankind—however great the proceeds, if at
the same time it is lavish and extravagant, there will be no
great profits left. Cato looks upon a vineyard as the most<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
profitable investment; and he is far from wrong in that opinion,
seeing that he takes such particular care to retrench all
superfluous expenses. In the second rank he places gardens
that have a good supply of water, and with good reason,
too, supposing always that they are near a town. The ancients
gave to meadow lands the name of “parata,” or lands “always
ready.”<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Cato being asked, on one occasion, what was the most certain
source of profit, “Good pasture land,” was his answer;
upon which, enquiry was made what was the next best. “Pretty
good<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> pasture lands,” said he—the amount of all which is, that
he looked upon that as the most certain source of income
which stands in need of the smallest outlay. This, however,
will naturally vary in degree, according to the nature of the
respective localities; and the same is the case with the maxim<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
to which he gives utterance, that a good agriculturist must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
fond of selling. The same, too, with his remark, that in his
youth a landowner should begin to plant without delay, but
that he ought not to build until the land is fully brought into
cultivation, and then only a little at a time: and that the best
plan is, as the common proverb has it, “To profit by the folly
of others;”<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> taking due care, however, that the keeping up of
a farm-house does not entail too much expense. Still, however,
those persons are guilty of no falsehood who are in the
habit of saying that a proprietor who is well housed comes all
the oftener to his fields, and that “the master’s forehead is
of more use than his back.”<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_7"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 7. (6.)—THE PROPER ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FARM-HOUSE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The proper plan to be pursued is this:<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> the farm-house must
not be unsuitable for the farm, nor the farm for the house; and
we must be on our guard against following the examples of L.
Lucullus and Q. Sc&aelig;vola, who, though living in the same age,
fell into the two opposite extremes; for whereas the farm-house
of Sc&aelig;vola was not large enough for the produce of his farm,
the farm of Lucullus was not sufficiently large for the house he
built upon it; an error which gave occasion to the reproof of
the censors, that on his farm there was less of ground for
ploughing than of floor for sweeping. The proper arrangements
for a farm-house are not to be made without a certain
degree of skill. C. Marius, who was seven times consul, was
the last person who had one built at Misenum;<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> but he erected
it with such a degree of that artistic skill which he had displayed
in castrametation, that Sylla Felix<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> even made the
remark, that in comparison with Marius, all the others had
been no better than blind.<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>It is generally agreed, that a farm-house ought neither to
be built near a marsh, nor with a river in front of it; for, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Homer<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> has remarked, with the greatest correctness, unwholesome
vapours are always exhaled from rivers before the rising
of the sun. In hot localities, a farm-house should have a
northern aspect, but where it is cold, it should look towards
the south; where, on the other hand, the site is temperate, the
house should look due east. Although, when speaking<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> of
the best kinds of soil, I may seem to have sufficiently discussed
the characteristics by which it may be known, I shall take the
present opportunity of adding a few more indications, employing
the words of Cato<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> more particularly for the purpose.
“The dwarf-elder,” says he, “the wild plum,<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> the bramble
the small bulb,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> trefoil, meadow grass,<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> the quercus, and the
wild pear and wild apple, are all of them indicative of a corn
land. The same is the case, too, where the land is black, or
of an ashy colour. All chalky soils are scorching, unless they
are very thin; the same, too, with sand, unless it is remarkably
fine. These remarks, however, are more applicable to champaign
localities than declivities.”</p>

<p>The ancients were of opinion, that before everything, moderation
should be observed in the extent of a farm; for it was
a favourite maxim of theirs, that we ought to sow the less, and
plough the more: such too, I find, was the opinion entertained
by Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and indeed, if we must confess the truth, it is the
wide-spread domains that have been the ruin<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of Italy, and
soon will be that of the provinces as well. Six proprietors
were in possession of one half of Africa,<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> at the period when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the Emperor Nero had them put to death. With that greatness
of mind which was so peculiarly his own, and of which
he ought not to lose the credit, Cneius Pompeius would never
purchase the lands that belonged to a neighbour. Mago has
stated it as his opinion, that a person, on buying a farm, ought
at once to sell his town house;<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> an opinion, however, which
savours of too great rigidity, and is by no means conformable to
the public good. It is with these words, indeed, that he begins
his precepts; a good proof, at all events, that he looks upon the
personal inspection of the owner as of primary importance.</p>

<p>The next point which requires our care is to employ a farm-steward<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
of experience, and upon this, too, Cato<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> has given
many useful precepts. Still, however, it must suffice for
me to say that the steward ought to be a man nearly as clever
as his master, though without appearing to know it. It is the
very worst plan of all, to have land tilled by slaves let loose
from the houses of correction, as, indeed, is the case with all
work entrusted to men who live without hope. I may possibly
appear guilty of some degree of rashness in making mention of
a maxim of the ancients, which will very probably be looked
upon as quite incredible—“That nothing is so disadvantageous
as to cultivate land in the highest style of perfection.” L.
Tarius Rufus, a man who, born in the very lowest ranks of
life, by his military talents finally attained the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
and who in other respects adhered to the old-fashioned notions
of thriftiness, made away with about one hundred millions of
sesterces, which, by the liberality of the late Emperor Augustus,
he had contrived to amass, in buying up lands in Picenum,
and cultivating them in the highest style, his object being to
gain a name thereby; the consequence of which was, that his
heir renounced<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> the inheritance. Are we of opinion, then,
that ruin and starvation must be the necessary consequence of
such a course as this? Yes, by Hercules! and the very best
plan of all is to let moderation guide our judgment in all things.
To cultivate land well is absolutely necessary, but to cultivate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
it in the very highest style is mere extravagance, unless, indeed,
the work is done by the hands of a man’s own family, his
tenants, or those whom he is obliged to keep at any rate. But
besides this, even when the owner tills the land itself, there
are some crops which it is really not worth the while to gather,
if we only take into account the manual labour expended upon
them. The olive, too, should never be too highly<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> cultivated,
nor must certain soils, it is said, be too carefully tilled, those
of Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> for instance; hence it is, that new comers there so
often find themselves deceived.<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 8.—MAXIMS OF THE ANCIENTS ON AGRICULTURE.</span></h3></div>

<p>In what way, then, can land be most profitably cultivated?
Why, in the words of our agricultural oracles, “by making
good out of bad.” But here it is only right that we should say
a word in justification of our forefathers, who in their precepts
on this subject had nothing else in view but the benefit of
mankind: for when they use the term “bad” here, they only
mean to say that which costs the smallest amount of money.
The principal object with them was in all cases to cut down
expenses to the lowest possible sum; and it was in this spirit
that they made the enactments which pronounced it criminal
for a person who had enjoyed a triumph, to be in possession,
among his other furniture, of ten pounds’ weight of silver
plate: which permitted a man, upon the death of his farm-steward,
to abandon all his victories, and return to the cultivation
of his lands—such being the men the culture of whose
farms the state used to take upon itself; and thus, while they
led our armies, did the senate act as their steward.</p>

<p>It was in the same spirit, too, that those oracles of ours
have given utterance to these other precepts, to the effect that
he is a bad agriculturist who has to buy what his farm might
have supplied him with; that the man is a bad manager who
does in the day-time what he might have done in the night,
except, indeed, when the state of the weather does not allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
it; that he is a worse manager still, who does on a work-day
what he might have done on a feast-day;<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> but that he is the
very worst of all, who works under cover in fine weather, instead
of labouring in the fields.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from taking the present opportunity of
quoting one illustration afforded us by ancient times, from
which it will be found that it was the usage in those days to
bring before the people even questions connected with the
various methods employed in agriculture, and will be seen in
what way men were accustomed to speak out in their own
defence. C. Furius Chresimus, a freedman, having found himself
able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far more
abundant harvests than his neighbours could from the largest
farms, became the object of very considerable jealousy among
them, and was accordingly accused of enticing away the crops
of others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day was
named by Spurius Calvinus, the curule &aelig;dile, for his appearance.
Apprehensive of being condemned, when the question
came to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had all his
implements of husbandry brought into the Forum, together
with his farm servants, robust, well-conditioned, and well-clad
people, Piso says. The iron tools were of first-rate quality,
the mattocks were stout and strong, the plough-shares ponderous
and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condition.
When all this had been done, “Here, Roman citizens,”
said he, “are my implements of magic; but it is impossible
for me to exhibit to your view, or to bring into this
Forum, those midnight toils of mine, those early watchings,
those sweats, and those fatigues.” Upon this, by the unanimous
voice of the people, he was immediately acquitted.
Agriculture, in fact, depends upon the expenditure of labour
and exertion; and hence it is that the ancients were in the
habit of saying, that it is the eye of the master that does more
towards fertilizing a field than anything else.</p>

<p>We shall give the rest of these precepts in their appropriate
places, according as we find them adapted to each variety of
cultivation; but in the meantime we must not omit some of a
general nature, which here recur to our recollection, and more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
particularly that maxim of Cato, as profitable as it is humane:
“Always act in such a way as to secure the love of your neighbours.”
He then proceeds to state his reasons for giving this
advice, but it appears to me that no one surely can entertain
the slightest doubt upon the subject. One of the very first
recommendations that he gives is to take every care that the
farm servants are kept in good condition.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> It is a maxim
universally agreed upon in agriculture, that nothing must be
done too late; and again, that everything must be done at its
proper season; while there is a third precept, which reminds
us that opportunities lost can never be regained. The malediction
uttered by Cato against rotten ground has been treated
of at some length already;<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> but there is another precept which
he is never tired of repeating, “Whatever can be done by the
help of the ass, will cost the least money.”</p>

<p>Fern will be sure to die at the end of a couple of years, if
you prevent it from putting forth leaves; the most efficient method
of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while
they are in bud; for then the juices that drop from it will kill
the roots.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again
if it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer
solstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it
is turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> upon it.
In the same way, too, we are told that reeds may be effectually
ploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the
share. A field infested with rushes should be turned up with
the spade, or, if the locality is stony, with a two-pronged
mattock: overgrown shrubs are best removed by fire. Where
ground is too moist, it is an advantageous plan to cut trenches
in it and so drain it; where the soil is cretaceous, these trenches
should he left open; and where it is loose, they should be
strengthened with a hedge to prevent them from falling in.
When these drains are made on a declivity, they should have
a layer of gutter tiles at the bottom, or else house tiles with the
face upwards: in some cases, too, they should be covered<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
with earth, and made to run into others of a larger size and
wider; the bottom, also, should, if possible, have a coating of
stones or of gravel. The openings, too, should be strengthened
with two stones placed on either side, and another laid upon
the top. Democritus has described a method of rooting up a
forest, by first macerating the flower of the lupine<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> for one day
in the juice of hemlock, and then watering the roots of the trees with it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 9. (7.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GRAIN.</span></h3></div>

<p>As the field is now prepared, we shall proceed to speak of
the nature of the various kinds of grain; we must premise,
however, that there are two principal classes of grain, the
cereals,<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> comprising wheat and barley, and the legumina, such
as the bean and the chick-pea, for instance. The difference
between these two classes is too well known to require any
further description.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_10"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 10.—THE HISTORY OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GRAIN.</span></h3></div>

<p>The cereals are divided again into the same number of
varieties, according to the time of the year at which they
are sown. The winter grains are those which are put in
the ground about the setting of the Vergili&aelig;,<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and there receive
their nutriment throughout the winter, for instance,
wheat,<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> spelt,<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and barley.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The summer grains are those
which are sown in summer, before the rising of the Vergili&aelig;,<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
such as millet,<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> panic,<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> sesame,<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> horminum,<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and irio,<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> in
accordance, however, with the usage of Italy only; for in
Greece and Asia all the grains are sown just after the setting of
the Vergili&aelig;. There are some, again, that are sown at either
season in Italy, and others at a third period, or, in other
words, in the spring. Some authors give the name of spring-grain
to millet, panic, lentils,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> chick-peas,<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and alica,<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
while they call wheat, barley, beans, turnips, and rape, sementive
or early sowing seeds. Certain species of wheat are only
sown to make fodder for cattle, and are known by the name of
“farrago,”<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> or mixed grain; the same, too, with the leguminous
plants, the vetch, for instance. The lupine,<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> however, is
grown in common as food for both cattle and men.</p>

<p>All the leguminous<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> plants, with the exception of the bean,
have a single root, hard and tough, like wood, and destitute of
numerous ramifications; the chick-pea has the deepest root of
all. Corn has numerous fibrous roots, but no ramifications.
Barley makes its appearance<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> above ground the seventh day
after sowing; the leguminous plants on the fourth, or at the
very latest, the seventh; the bean from the fifteenth day to
the twentieth: though in Egypt the leguminous plants appear
as early as the third day after they are sown. In barley, one
extremity of the grain throws out the root, and the other the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
blade; this last flowers, too, before the other grain. In the
cereals in general it is the thicker end of the seed that throws
out the root, the thinner end the blossom; while in the other
seeds both root and blossom issue from the same part.</p>

<p>During the winter, corn is in the blade; but in the spring
winter corn throws out a tall stem. As for millet and panic,
they grow with a jointed and grooved<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> stalk, while sesame has
a stem resembling that of fennel-giant. The fruit of all these
seeds is either contained in an ear, as in wheat and barley, for
instance, and protected from the attacks of birds and small
animals by a prickly beard bristling like so many palisades; or
else it is enclosed in pods, as in the leguminous plants, or in
capsules, as in sesame and the poppy. Millet and panic can
only be said to belong to the grower and the small birds in
common, as they have nothing but a thin membrane to cover
them, without the slightest protection. Panic receives that
name from the panicule<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> or down that is to be seen upon it;
the head of it droops languidly, and the stalk tapers gradually
in thickness, being of almost the toughness and consistency
of wood: the head is loaded with grain closely packed,
there being a tuft upon the top, nearly a foot in length. In
millet the husks which embrace the grain bend downward with
a wavy tuft upon the edge. There are several varieties of
panic, the mammose, for instance, the ears of which are in
clusters with small edgings of down, the head of the plant
being double; it is distinguished also according to the colour,
the white, for instance, the black, the red, and the purple
even. Several kinds of bread are made from millet, but very
little from panic: there is no grain known that weighs heavier
than millet, and which swells more in baking. A modius of
millet will yield sixty pounds’ weight of bread; and three
sextarii steeped in water will make one modius of fermenty.<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
A kind of millet<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> has been introduced from India into Italy
within the last ten years, of a swarthy colour, large grain, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
stalk like that of the reed. This stalk springs up to the height
of seven feet, and has tufts of a remarkable size, known by the
name of “phob&aelig;.”<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> This is the most prolific of all the cereals,
for from a single grain no less than three sextarii<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> are produced:
it requires, however, to be sown in a humid soil.</p>

<p>Some kinds of corn begin to form the ear at the third joint,
and others at the fourth, though at its first formation the ear
remains still concealed. Wheat, however, has four<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> articulations,
spelt<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> six, and barley eight. In the case of these last,
the ear does not begin to form before the number of joints, as
above mentioned, is complete. Within four or five days, at
the very latest, after the ear has given signs of forming, the
plant begins to flower, and in the course of as many days or a
little more, sheds its blossom: barley blossoms at the end of
seven days at the very latest. Varro says that the grains are
perfectly formed at the end of four times<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> nine days from their
flowering, and are ready for cutting at the ninth month.</p>

<p>The bean, again, first appears in leaf, and then throws out
a stalk, which has no articulations<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> upon it. The other leguminous
plants have a tough, ligneous stalk, and some of them
throw out branches, the chick-pea, the fitch, and the lentil,
for instance. In some of the leguminous plants, the pea, for
example, the stem creeps along the ground, if care is not taken
to support it by sticks: if this precaution is omitted, the
quality is deteriorated. The bean and the lupine are the only
ones among the leguminous plants that have a single stem: in
all the others the stem throws out branches, being of a ligneous
nature, very thin, and in all cases hollow. Some of
these plants throw out the leaves from the root, others at the
top.<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Wheat, barley, and the vetch, all the plants, in fact,
which produce straw, have a single leaf only at the summit:
in barley, however, this leaf is rough, while in the others it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
is smooth. * * * In the bean, again, the chick-pea, and the
pea, the leaves are numerous and divided. In corn the leaf
is similar to that of the reed, while in the bean it is round, as
also in a great proportion of the leguminous plants. In the
ervilia<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> and the pea the leaf is long,<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> in the kidney-bean
veined, and in sesame<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and irio the colour of blood. The
lupine and the poppy are the only ones among these plants that
lose<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> their leaves.</p>

<p>The leguminous plants remain a longer time in flower, the
fitch and the chick-pea more particularly; but the bean is in
blossom the longest of them all, for the flower remains on it
forty days; not, indeed, that each stalk retains its blossom
for all that length of time, but, as the flower goes off in
one, it comes on in another. In the bean, too, the crop is not
ripe all at once, as is the case with corn; for the pods make
their appearance at different times, at the lowest parts first,
the blossom mounting upwards by degrees.</p>

<p>When the blossom is off in corn, the stalk gradually thickens,
and it ripens within forty days at the most. The same is the
case, too, with the bean, but the chick-pea takes a much shorter
time to ripen; indeed, it is fit for gathering within forty days
from the time that it is sown. Millet, panic, sesame, and all the
summer grains are ripe within forty days after blossoming,
with considerable variations, of course, in reference to soil and
weather. Thus, in Egypt, we find barley cut at the end of
six months, and wheat at the end of seven, from the time of
sowing. In Hellas, again, barley is cut in the seventh month,
and in Peloponnesus in the eighth; the wheat being got in at
a still later period.</p>

<p>Those grains which grow on a stalk of straw are enclosed
in an envelope protected by a prickly beard; while in the bean
and the leguminous plants in general they are enclosed in pods
upon branches which shoot alternately from either side. The
cereals are the best able to withstand the winter, but the leguminous
plants afford the most substantial food. In wheat, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
grain has several coats, but in barley,<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> more particularly, it is
naked and exposed; the same, too, with arinca,<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> but most of
all, the oat. The stem is taller in wheat than it is in barley,
but the ear is more bearded<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> in the last. Wheat, barley, and
winter-wheat<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> are threshed out; they are cleaned, too, for
sowing just as they are prepared for the mill, there being no
necessity for parching<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> them. Spelt, on the other hand, millet,
and panic, cannot be cleaned without parching them; hence it
is that they are always sown raw and with the chaff on. Spelt
is preserved in the husk, too, for sowing, and, of course, is not
in such case parched by the action of fire.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_11"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 11.—SPELT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of all these grains barley is the lightest,<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> its weight rarely
exceeding fifteen pounds to the modius, while that of the bean
is twenty-two. Spelt is much heavier than barley, and wheat
heavier than spelt. In Egypt they make a meal<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> of olyra,<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
a third variety of corn that grows there. The Gauls have
also a kind of spelt peculiar to that country: they give it the
name of “brace,”<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> while to us it is known as “sandala:” it
has a grain of remarkable whiteness. Another difference,
again, is the fact that it yields nearly four pounds more of
bread to the modius than any other kind of spelt. Verrius
states that for three hundred years the Romans made use of no
other meal than that of corn.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_12"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 12.—WHEAT.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are numerous kinds of wheat which have received
their names from the countries where they were first produced.
For my part, however, I can compare no kind of wheat to
that of Italy either for whiteness or weight, qualities for which
it is more particularly distinguished: indeed it is only with
the produce of the more mountainous parts of Italy that the
foreign wheats can be put in comparison. Among these the
wheat of Bœotia<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> occupies the first rank, that of Sicily the
second, and that of Africa the third. The wheats of Thrace,
Syria, and, more recently, of Egypt, used to hold the third rank
for weight, these facts having been ascertained through the
medium of the athletes; whose powers of consumption, equal
to those of beasts of burden, have established the gradations in
weight, as already stated. Greece, too, held the Pontic<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> wheat
in high esteem; but this has not reached Italy as yet. Of
all the varieties of grain, however, the Greeks gave the preference
to the kinds called dracontion, strangia, and Selinusium,
the chief characteristic of which is a stem of remarkable thickness:
it was this, in the opinion of the Greeks, that marked
them as the peculiar growth of a rich soil. On the other hand,
they recommended for sowing in humid soils an extremely
light and diminutive species of grain, with a remarkably thin
stalk, known to them as speudias, and standing in need of an
abundance of nutriment. Such, at all events, were the opinions
generally entertained in the reign of Alexander the Great,
at a time when Greece was at the height of her glory, and the
most powerful country in the world. Still, however, nearly
one hundred and forty-four years before the death of that
prince we find the poet Sophocles, in his Tragedy of “Triptolemus,”
praising the corn of Italy before all others. The
passage, translated word for word, is to the following effect:—</p>

<p>
“And favour’d Italy grows white with hoary wheat.”<br />
</p>

<p>And it is this whiteness that is still one of the peculiar merits
of the Italian wheat; a circumstance which makes me the more
surprised to find that none of the Greek writers of a later
period have made any reference to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Of the various kinds of wheat which are imported at the
present day into Rome, the lightest in weight are those which
come from Gaul and Chersonnesus; for, upon weighing them,
it will be found that they do not yield more than twenty
pounds to the modius. The grain of Sardinia weighs half a
pound more, and that of Alexandria one-third of a pound more
than that of Sardinia; the Sicilian wheat is the same in
weight as the Alexandrian. The Bœotian wheat, again, weighs
a whole pound more than these last, and that of Africa a pound
and three quarters. In Italy beyond the Padus, the spelt, to
my knowledge, weighs twenty-five pounds to the modius, and,
in the vicinity of Clusium, six-and-twenty. We find it a
rule, universally established by Nature, that in every kind of
commissariat bread<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> that is made, the bread exceeds the weight
of the grain by one-third; and in the same way it is generally
considered that that is the best kind of wheat, which, in
kneading, will absorb one congius of water.<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> There are some
kinds of wheat which give, when used by themselves, an additional
weight equal to this: the Balearic wheat, for instance,
which to a modius of grain yields thirty-five pounds weight of
bread. Others, again, will only give this additional weight
by being mixed with other kinds, the Cyprian wheat and the
Alexandrian, for example; which, if used by themselves, will
yield no more than twenty pounds to the modius. The wheat
of Cyprus is swarthy, and produces a dark bread; for which
reason it is generally mixed with the white wheat of Alexandria;
the mixture yielding twenty-five pounds of bread to the
modius of grain. The wheat of Thebais, in Egypt, when
made into bread, yields twenty-six pounds to the modius. To
knead the meal with sea-water, as is mostly done in the maritime
districts, for the purpose of saving the salt, is extremely
pernicious; there is nothing, in fact, that will more readily
predispose the human body to disease. In Gaul and Spain,
where they make a drink<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> by steeping corn in the way that
has been already described—they employ the foam<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> which
thickens upon the surface as a leaven: hence it is that
the bread in those countries is lighter than that made elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>There are some differences, also, in the stem of wheat; for
the better the kind the thicker it is. In Thrace, the stem of
the wheat is covered with several coats,<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> which are rendered
absolutely necessary by the excessive cold of those regions.
It is the cold, also, that led to the discovery there of the three-month<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
wheat, the ground being covered with snow most
of the year. At the end mostly of three months after it has
been sown, this wheat is ready for cutting, both in Thrace and
in other parts of the world as well. This variety is well known,
too, throughout all the Alpine range, and in the northern provinces
there is no kind of wheat that is more prolific; it has
a single stem only, is by no means of large size in any part of
it, and is never sown but in a thin, light soil. There is a two-month<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
wheat also found in the vicinity of &AElig;nos, in Thrace,
which ripens the fortieth day after sowing; and yet it is a
surprising fact, that there is no kind of wheat that weighs
heavier than this, while at the same time it produces no bran.
Both Sicily and Achaia grow it, in the mountainous districts
of those countries; as also Eubœa, in the vicinity of Carystus.
So greatly, then, is Columella in error,<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> in supposing that
there is no distinct variety of three-month wheat even; the
fact being that these varieties have been known from the very
earliest times. The Greeks give to these wheats the name
of “setanion.” It is said that in Bactria the grains of wheat
are of such an enormous size, that a single one is as large as
our ears of corn.<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_13"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 13.—BARLEY: RICE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of all the cereals the first that is sown is barley. We shall
state the appropriate time for sowing each kind when we come
to treat of the nature of each individually. In India, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
both a cultivated and a wild<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> barley, from which they make
excellent bread, as well as alica.<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> But the most favourite
food of all there is rice,<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> from which they prepare a ptisan<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
similar to that made from barley in other parts of the world.
The leaves of rice are fleshy,<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> very like those of the leek, but
broader; the stem is a cubit in height, the blossom purple,
and the root globular, like a pearl in shape.<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_14"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 14.—POLENTA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Barley is one of the most ancient aliments of man, a fact
that is proved by a custom of the Athenians, mentioned by
Menander,<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> as also by the name of “hordearii,”<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> that used to
be given to gladiators. The Greeks, too, prefer barley to anything
else for making polenta.<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> This food is made in various
ways: in Greece, the barley is first steeped in water, and then
left a night to dry. The next day they parch it, and then
grind it in the mill. Some persons parch it more highly, and
then sprinkle it again with a little water; after which they
dry it for grinding. Others shake the grain from out of the
ear while green, and, after cleaning and soaking it in water,
pound it in a mortar. They then wash the paste in baskets,
and leave it to dry in the sun; after which they pound it again,
clean it, and grind it in the mill. But whatever the mode of
preparation adopted, the proportions are always twenty pounds
of barley to three pounds of linseed,<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> half a pound of coriander,
and fifteen drachm&aelig;<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> of salt: the ingredients are first parched,
and then ground in the mill.</p>

<p>Those who want it for keeping, store it in new earthen
vessels, with fine flour and bran. In Italy, the barley is
parched without being steeped in water, and then ground to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
fine meal, with the addition of the ingredients already mentioned,
and some millet as well. Barley bread, which was
extensively used by the ancients, has now fallen into universal
disrepute, and is mostly used as a food for cattle only.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_15"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 15.—PTISAN.</span></h3></div>

<p>With barley, too, the food called ptisan<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> is made, a most
substantial and salutary aliment, and one that is held in very
high esteem. Hippocrates, one of the most famous writers on
medical science, has devoted a whole volume to the praises of
this aliment. The ptisan of the highest quality is that which
is made at Utica; that of Egypt is prepared from a kind of
barley, the grain of which grows with two points.<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> In B&aelig;tica
and Africa, the kind of barley from which this food is made is
that which Turranius calls the “smooth”<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> barley: the same
author expresses an opinion, too, that olyra<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> and rice are the
same. The method of preparing ptisan is universally known.</p>

three-month wheat. The invention of it we owe to the island
of Chios, and still, at the present day, the most esteemed kind
comes from there; it derives its name from its being made
without the help of the mill.<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Next to the amylum made
with three-month wheat, is that which is prepared from the
lighter kinds of wheat. In making it, the grain is soaked in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
fresh water, placed in wooden vessels; care being taken to keep
it covered with the liquid, which is changed no less than five
times in the course of the day. If it can be changed at night
as well, it is all the better for it, the object being to let it
imbibe the water gradually and equally. When it is quite
soft, but before it turns sour, it is passed through linen cloth,
or else wicker-work, after which it is poured out upon a tile
covered with leaven, and left to harden in the sun. Next to
the amylum of Chios, that of Crete is the most esteemed, and
next to that the &AElig;gyptian. The tests of its goodness are its
being light and smooth: it should be used, too, while it is
fresh. Cato,<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> among our writers, has made mention of it.</p>

<p>Barley-meal, too, is employed for medicinal purposes; and
it is a curious fact, that for beasts of burden they make a paste
of it, which is first hardened by the action of fire, and then
ground. It is then made up into balls, which are introduced
with the hand into the paunch, the result of which is, that the
vigour and muscular strength of the animal is considerably
increased. In some kinds of barley, the ears have two rows
of grains,<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and in others more; in some cases, as many as six.<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
The grain itself, too, presents certain differences, being long
and thin, or else short or round, white, black,<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> or, in some
instances, of a purple colour. This last kind is employed for
making polenta: the white is ill adapted for standing the severity
of the weather. Barley is the softest of all the grains:
it can only be sown in a dry, loose soil,<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> but fertile withal.
The chaff of barley ranks among the very best; indeed, for
litter there is none that can be compared with it. Of all grain,
barley is the least exposed to accidents, as it is gathered before
the time that mildew begins to attack wheat; for which reason
it is that the provident agriculturist sows only as much wheat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
as may be required for food. The saying is, that “barley is
sown in a money-bag,” because it so soon returns a profit.
The most prolific kind of all is that which is got in at Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
in Spain, in the month of April. It is in the same
month that it is sown in Celtiberia, and yet it yields two harvests
in the same year. All kinds of barley are cut sooner than
other grain, and immediately after they are ripe; for the straw
is extremely brittle, and the grain is enclosed in a husk of remarkable
thinness. It is said, too, that a better polenta<a id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> is
made from it, if it is gathered before it is perfectly ripe.</p>

ARE GROWN IN THE EAST.</span></h3></div>

<p>The several kinds of corn are not everywhere the same; and
even where they are the same, they do not always bear a similar
name. The kinds most universally grown are spelt, by the
ancients known as “adorea,” winter wheat,<a id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and wheat;<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> all
these being common to many countries. Arinca was originally
peculiar to Gaul, though now it is widely diffused over Italy
as well. Egypt, too, Syria, Cilicia, Asia, and Greece, have their
own peculiar kinds, known by the names of zea,<a id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> olyra, and
tiphe.<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> In Egypt, they make a fine flour from wheat of their
own growth, but it is by no means equal to that of Italy.
Those countries which employ zea, have no spelt. Zea, however,
is to be found in Italy, and in Campania more particularly,
where it is known by the name of “seed.”<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The grain that
bears this name enjoys a very considerable celebrity, as we
shall have occasion to state<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> on another occasion; and it is in
honour of this that Homer<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> uses the expression, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζείδωρος
ἄρουρα</span>, and not, as some suppose, from the fact of the earth
giving life.<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Amylum is made, too, from this grain, but of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
coarser<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> quality than the kind already mentioned;<a id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> this,
however, is the only difference that is perceptible.</p>

<p>The most hardy kind, however, of all the grains is spelt, and
the best to stand the severity of the weather; it will grow in
the very coldest places, as also in localities that are but half
tilled, or soils that are extremely hot, and destitute of water.
This was the earliest food of the ancient inhabitants of Latium;
a strong proof of which is the distributions of adorea that
were made in those times, as already stated.<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> It is evident,
too, that the Romans subsisted for a long time upon pottage,<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
and not bread; for we find that from its name of “puls,” certain
kinds of food are known, even at the present day, as “pulmentaria.”<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
Ennius, too, the most ancient of our poets, in
describing the famine in a siege, relates how that the parents
snatched away the messes of pottage<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> from their weeping
children. At the present day, even, the sacrifices in conformity
with the ancient rites, as well as those offered upon birthdays,
are made with parched pottage.<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> This food appears to have
been as much unknown in those days in Greece as polenta was
in Italy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_20"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 20.—WINTER WHEAT. SIMILAGO, OR FINE FLOUR.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is no grain that displays a greater avidity than wheat,
and none that absorbs a greater quantity of nutriment. With
all propriety I may justly call winter wheat<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> the very choicest
of all the varieties of wheat. It is white, destitute of all
flavour,<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and not oppressive<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> to the stomach. It suits moist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
localities particularly well, such as we find in Italy and Gallia
Comata; but beyond the Alps it is found to maintain its character
only in the territory of the Allobroges and that of the
Memini; for in the other parts of those countries it degenerates
at the end of two years into common wheat.<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> The only
method of preventing this is to take care and sow the heaviest
grains only.</p>

<p>(9.) Winter wheat furnishes bread of the very finest quality
and the most esteemed delicacies of the bakers. The best
bread that is known in Italy is made from a mixture of Campanian
winter wheat with that of Pis&aelig;. The Campanian kind
is of a redder colour, while the latter is white; when mixed
with chalk,<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> it is increased in weight. The proper proportion
for the yield of Campanian wheat to the modius of grain is
four sextarii of what is known as bolted flour;<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> but when it
is used in the rough and has not been bolted, then the yield
should be five sextarii of flour. In addition to this, in either
case there should be half a modius of white meal, with four
sextarii of coarse meal, known as “seconds,” and the same
quantity of bran.<a id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The Pisan wheat produces five sextarii of
fine flour to the modius; in other respects it yields the same
as that of Campania. The wheat of Clusium and Arretium
gives another sextarius of fine flour, but the yield is similar to
that of the kinds already mentioned in all other respects.
If, however, as much of it as possible is converted into fine
wheat meal, the modius will yield sixteen pounds weight of
white bread, and three of seconds, with half a modius of bran.
These differences, however, depend very materially upon the
grinding; for when the grain is ground quite dry it produces
more meal, but when sprinkled with salt water<a id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> a whiter
flour, though at the same time a greater quantity of bran. It
is very evident that “farina,” the name we give to meal, is
derived from “far.” A modius of meal made from Gallic winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
wheat, yields twenty-two pounds of bread; while that of Italy,
if made into bread baked in tins,<a id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> will yield two or three
pounds more. When the bread is baked in the oven,<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> two
pounds must be added in weight in either case.</p>

<p>(10.) Wheat yields a fine flour<a id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> of the very highest quality.
In African wheat the modius ought to yield half a modius of
fine flour and five sextarii of pollen, that being the name
given to fine wheat meal, in the same way that that of winter
wheat is generally known as “flos,” or the “flower.” This
fine meal is extensively used in copper works and paper manufactories.
In addition to the above, the modius should yield
four sextarii of coarse meal, and the same quantity of bran.
The finest wheaten flour will yield one hundred<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> and twenty-two
pounds of bread, and the fine meal of winter wheat one
hundred<a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> and seventeen, to the modius of grain. When the
prices of grain are moderate, meal sells at forty asses the modius,
bolted wheaten flour at eight asses more, and bolted
flour of winter wheat, at sixteen asses more. There is another
distinction again in fine wheaten flour, which originated formerly
in the days of L. Paulus. There were three classes of
wheat; the first of which would appear to have yielded seventeen
pounds of bread, the second eighteen, and the third nineteen
pounds and a third: to these were added two pounds and
a half of seconds,<a id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> and the same quantity of brown<a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> bread,
with six sextarii of bran.<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>Winter wheat never ripens all at once, and yet there is none
of the cereals that can so ill brook any delay; it being of so
delicate a nature, that the ears directly they are ripe will begin
to shed their grain. So long, however, as it is in stalk, it is
exposed to fewer risks than other kinds of wheat, from the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of its always having the ear upright, and not retaining the
dew, which is a prolific cause of mildew.</p>

<p>From arinca<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> a bread of remarkable sweetness is made.
The grains in this variety lie closer than they do in spelt; the
ear, too, is larger and more weighty. It is rarely the case
that a modius of this grain does not weigh full sixteen pounds.
In Greece they find great difficulty in threshing it; and hence
it is that we find Homer<a id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> saying that it is given to beasts of
burden, this being the same as the grain that he calls “olyra.”
In Egypt it is threshed without any difficulty, and is remarkably
prolific. Spelt has no beard, and the same is the case
with winter wheat, except<a id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> that known as the Laconian
variety. To the kinds already mentioned we have to add
bromos,<a id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> the winter wheat just excepted, and tragos,<a id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> all of
them exotics introduced from the East, and very similar to
rice. Tiphe<a id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> also belongs to the same class, from which in
our part of the world a cleaned grain resembling rice is prepared.
Among the Greeks, too, there is the grain known
as zea; and it is said that this, as well as tiphe, when cleaned
from the husk and sown, will degenerate<a id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> and assume the
form of wheat; not immediately, but in the course of three
years.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_21"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 21.—THE FRUITFULNESS OF AFRICA IN WHEAT.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is no grain more prolific than wheat, Nature having
bestowed upon it this quality, as being the substance which she
destined for the principal nutriment of man. A modius of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
wheat, if the soil is favourable, as at Byzacium,<a id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> a champaign
district of Africa, will yield as much as one hundred and fifty<a id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
modii of grain. The procurator of the late Emperor Augustus
sent him from that place—a fact almost beyond belief—little
short of four hundred shoots all springing from a single grain;
and we have still in existence his letters on the subject. In
a similar manner, too, the procurator of Nero sent him three
hundred and sixty stalks all issuing from a single grain.<a id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> The
plains of Leontium in Sicily, and other places in that island,
as well as the whole of B&aelig;tica, and Egypt more particularly,
yield produce a hundred-fold. The most prolific kinds of
wheat are the ramose wheat,<a id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and that known as the “hundred-grain”<a id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
wheat. Before now, as many as one hundred
beans, too, have been found on a single stalk.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_22"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 22.—SESAME. ERYSIMUM, OR IRIO. HORMINUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have spoken<a id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> of sesame, millet, and panic as belonging
to the summer grains. Sesame<a id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> comes from India, where they
extract an oil from it; the colour of its grain is white.
Similar in appearance to this is the erysimum of Asia and
Greece, and indeed it would be identical with it were it not
that the grain is better filled.<a id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> It is the same grain that is
known among us as “irio;” and strictly speaking, ought rather
to be classed among the medicaments than the cereals. Of the
same nature, too, is the plant called “horminum”<a id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> by the
Greeks, though resembling cummin<a id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> in appearance; it is sown
at the same time as sesame: no animal will eat either this or
irio while green.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_23"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 23.—THE MODE OF GRINDING CORN.</span></h3></div>

<p>All the grains are not easily broken. In Etruria they first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
parch the spelt in the ear, and then pound it with a pestle
shod with iron at the end. In this instrument the iron is
notched<a id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> at the bottom, sharp ridges running out like the
edge of a knife, and concentrating in the form of a star; so
that if care is not taken to hold the pestle perpendicularly
while pounding, the grains will only be splintered and the iron
teeth broken. Throughout the greater part of Italy, however,
they employ a pestle that is only rough<a id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> at the end, and
wheels turned by water, by means of which the corn is gradually
ground. I shall here set forth the opinions given by
Mago as to the best method of pounding corn. He says that
the wheat should be steeped first of all in water, and then
cleaned from the husk; after which it should be dried in the
sun, and then pounded with the pestle; the same plan, he
says, should be adopted in the preparation of barley. In the
latter case, however, twenty sextarii of grain require only two
sextarii of water. When lentils are used, they should be first
parched, and then lightly pounded with the bran; or else,
adopting another method, a piece of unbaked brick and half a
modius of sand<a id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> should be added to every twenty sextarii of
lentils.</p>

<p>Ervilia should be treated in the same way as lentils. Sesame
should be first steeped in warm water, and then laid out to
dry, after which it should be rubbed out briskly, and then
thrown into cold water, so that the chaff may be disengaged
by floating to the surface. After this is done, the grain should
again be spread out in the sun, upon linen cloths, to dry. Care,
however, should be taken to lose no time in doing this, as it is
apt to turn musty, and assume a dull, livid colour. The grains,
too, which are just cleaned from the husk, require various
methods of pounding. When the beard is ground by itself,
without the grain, the result is known as “acus,”<a id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> but it is
only used by goldsmiths.<a id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> If, on the other hand, it is beaten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
out on the threshing-floor, together with the straw, the chaff
has the name of “palea,” * * * * and in most parts of
the world is employed as fodder for beasts of burden. The
residue of millet, panic, and sesame, is known to us as
“apluda;” but in other countries it is called by various other
names.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_24"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 24.—MILLET.</span></h3></div>

<p>Campania is particularly prolific in millet, and a fine white
porridge is made from it: it makes a bread, too, of remarkable
sweetness. The nations of Sarmatia<a id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> live principally on this
porridge, and even the raw meal, with the sole addition of
mares’ milk, or else blood<a id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> extracted from the thigh of the
horse. The &AElig;thiopians know of no other grain but millet and
barley.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_25"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 25.—PANIC.</span></h3></div>

<p>The people of Gaul, and of Aquitania<a id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> more particularly,
make use of panic; the same is the case, too, in Italy beyond
the Padus, with the addition, however, of the bean, without
which they prepare none of their food. There is no aliment
held in higher esteem than panic by the nations of Pontus.
The other summer grains thrive better in well-watered soils
than in rainy localities; but water is by no means beneficial
to millet or panic when they are coming into blade. It is recommended
not to sow them among vines or fruit-trees, as it
is generally thought that these crops impoverish the soil.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_26"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 26. (11)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF LEAVEN.</span></h3></div>

<p>Millet is more particularly employed for making leaven; and
if kneaded with must,<a id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> it will keep a whole year. The same
is done, too, with the fine wheat-bran of the best quality; it
is kneaded with white must three days old, and then dried in
the sun, after which it is made into small cakes. When required
for making bread, these cakes are first soaked in water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and then boiled with the finest spelt flour, after which the whole
is mixed up with the meal; and it is generally thought that
this is the best method of making bread. The Greeks have
established a rule that for a modius of meal eight ounces of
leaven is enough.</p>

<p>These kinds of leaven, however, can only be made at the
time of vintage, but there is another leaven which may be prepared
with barley and water, at any time it may happen to be
required. It is first made up into cakes of two pounds in
weight, and these are then baked upon a hot hearth, or else in
an earthen dish upon hot ashes and charcoal, being left till
they turn of a reddish brown. When this is done, the cakes
are shut close in vessels, until they turn quite sour: when
wanted for leaven, they are steeped in water first. When
barley bread used to be made, it was leavened with the meal
of the fitch,<a id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> or else the chicheling vetch,<a id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> the proportion
being, two pounds of leaven to two modii and a half of barley
meal. At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared
from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this
purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt,
and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till
it begins to turn sour. In most cases, however, they do not
warm it at all, but only make use of a little of the dough that
has been kept from the day before. It is very evident that the
principle which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature,
and it is equally evident that those persons who are dieted
upon fermented bread are stronger<a id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> in body. Among the
ancients, too, it was generally thought that the heavier wheat
is, the more wholesome it is.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_27"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 27.—THE METHOD OF MAKING BREAD: ORIGIN OF THE ART.</span></h3></div>

<p>It seems to me quite unnecessary to enter into an account
of the various kinds of bread that are made. Some kinds, we
find, receive their names from the dishes with which they are
eaten, the oyster-bread,<a id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> for instance: others, again, from
their peculiar delicacy, the artolaganus,<a id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> or cake-bread, for
example; and others from the expedition with which they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
prepared, such as the “speusticus,”<a id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> or “hurry-bread.” Other
varieties receive their names from the peculiar method of
baking them, such as oven-bread,<a id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> tin-bread,<a id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> and mould-bread.<a id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
It is not so very long since that we had a bread introduced
from Parthia, known as water-bread,<a id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> from a method
in kneading it, of drawing out the dough by the aid of water,
a process which renders it remarkably light, and full of holes,
like a sponge: some call this Parthian bread. The excellence
of the finest kinds of bread depends principally on the goodness
of the wheat, and the fineness of the bolter. Some persons
knead the dough with eggs or milk, and butter even has been
employed for the purpose by nations that have had leisure to
cultivate the arts of peace, and to give their attention to the
art of making pastry. Picenum still maintains its ancient
reputation for making the bread which it was the first to invent,
alica<a id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> being the grain employed. The flour is kept in
soak for nine days, and is kneaded on the tenth with raisin
juice, in the shape of long rolls; after which it is baked in an
oven in earthen pots, till they break. This bread, however, is
never eaten till it has been well<a id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> soaked, which is mostly done
in milk mixed with honey.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_28"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 28.—WHEN BAKERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AT ROME.</span></h3></div>

<p>There were no bakers at Rome until<a id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> the war with King
Perseus, more than five hundred and eighty years after the
building of the City. The ancient Romans used to make their
own bread, it being an occupation which belonged to the women,
as we see the case in many nations even at the present
day. Plautus speaks of the artopta, or bread-tin, in his
Comedy of the Aulularia,<a id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> though there has been considerable
discussion for that very reason among the learned, whether or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
not that line really belongs to him. We have the fact, too,
well ascertained, in the opinion of Ateius Capito, that the
cooks in those days were in the habit of making the bread for
persons of affluence, while the name of “pistor”<a id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> was only
given to the person who pounded, or “pisebat,” the spelt. In
those times, they had no cooks in the number of their slaves,
but used to hire them for the occasion from the market. The
Gauls were the first to employ the bolter that is made of
horse-hair; while the people of Spain make their sieves and
meal-dressers of flax,<a id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> and the Egyptians of papyrus and
rushes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_29"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 29.—ALICA.</span></h3></div>

<p>But among the very first things of all, we ought to speak of
the method employed in preparing alica,<a id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> a most delightful
and most wholesome food, and which incontestably confers
upon Italy the highest rank among the countries that produce
the cereals. This delicacy is prepared, no doubt, in Egypt
as well, but of a very inferior quality, and not worth our notice.
In Italy, however, it is prepared in numerous places,
the territories of Verona and Pis&aelig;, for example; but that of
Campania is the most highly esteemed. There, at the foot of
mountains capped with clouds, runs a plain, not less in all than
forty miles in extent. The land here—to give a description
first of the nature of the soil—is dusty on the surface, but
spongy below, and as porous as pumice. The inconveniences
that generally arise from the close vicinity of mountains are
here converted into so many advantages: for the soil, acting
on it as a sort of filter, absorbs the water of the abundant
rains that fall; the consequence of which is, that the water not
being left to soak or form mud on the surface, the cultivation
is greatly facilitated thereby. This land does not return, by
the aid of any springs, the moisture it has thus absorbed, but
thoroughly digests it, by warming it in its bosom, in a heated
oven as it were. The ground is kept cropped the whole year
through, once with panic, and twice with spelt; and yet in the
spring, when the soil is allowed to have a moment’s repose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
it will produce roses more odoriferous by far than the cultivated
rose: for the earth here is never tired of producing, a circumstance
in which originated the common saying, that Campania
produces more unguents<a id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> than other countries do oil.</p>

<p>In the same degree, however, that the Campanian soil excels
that of all other countries, so does that part of it which is
known to us as Labori&aelig;,<a id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> and to the Greeks as Phlegr&aelig;um,
surpass all the rest. This district is bounded on two sides by
the consular high road, which leads from Puteoli to Capua on
the one side, and from Cum&aelig; on the other.</p>

<p>Alica is prepared from the grain called zea, which we have
already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> as being known to us as “seed” wheat.
The grain is cleansed in a wooden mortar, for fear lest stone,
from its hardness, should have the effect of grating it. The
motive power for raising the pestle, as is generally known, is
supplied by slaves working in chains, the end of it being enclosed
in a case of iron. After the husks have been removed
by this process, the pure grain is broken to pieces, the same
implements being employed. In this way, there are three
different kinds of alica made, the finest, the seconds, and the
coarse, which last is known as “aph&aelig;rema.”<a id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Still, however,
these various kinds have none of them that whiteness as yet
for which they are so distinguished, though even now they are
preferable to the Alexandrian alica. With this view—a most
singular fact—chalk<a id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> is mixed with the meal, which, upon
becoming well incorporated with it, adds very materially to
both the whiteness and the shortness<a id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> of the mixture. This
chalk is found between Puteoli and Neapolis, upon a hill called
Leucog&aelig;um;<a id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> and there is still in existence a decree of the
late Emperor Augustus, (who established a colony at Capua),
which orders a sum of twenty thousand sesterces to be paid
annually from his exchequer to the people of Neapolis, for the
lease of this hill. His motive for paying this rent, he stated,
was the fact that the people of Campania had alleged that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
was impossible to make their alica without the help of this
mineral. In the same hill, sulphur is found as well, and the
springs of Araxus issue from its declivities, the waters of which
are particularly efficacious for strengthening the sight, healing
wounds, and preventing the teeth from becoming loose.</p>

<p>A spurious kind of alica is made, more particularly of a degenerate
kind of zea grown in Africa; the ears of it are larger
and blacker than those of the genuine kind, and the straw is
short. This grain is pounded with sand, and even then it is
with the greatest difficulty that the outer coats are removed;
when stripped, the grain fills one half only of the original
measure. Gypsum, in the proportion of one fourth, is then
sprinkled<a id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> over it, and after the mixture has been well incorporated,
it is bolted through a meal-sieve. The portion that
remains behind, after this is done, is known as “excepticia,”<a id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>
and consists of the coarser parts; while that which has passed
through is submitted to a second process, with a finer sieve;
and that which then refuses to pass has the name of “secundaria.”<a id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
That, again, which, in a similar manner, is submitted
to a third sifting, with a sieve of the greatest fineness, which
will only admit of sand passing through it, is known as “cribraria,”<a id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
when it remains on the top of the sieve.</p>

<p>There is another method, again, that is employed every
where for adulterating it. They pick out the whitest and
largest grains of wheat, and parboil them in earthen pots; these
are then dried in the sun till they have regained their original
size, after which they are lightly sprinkled with water, and
then ground in a mill. A better gran&aelig;um<a id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> is made from zea
than from wheat, although it is nothing else, in fact, but a
spurious alica: it is whitened by the addition of boiled milk,
in place of chalk.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_30"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 30. (12.)—THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS: THE BEAN.</span></h3></div>

<p>We now come to the history of the leguminous plants,
among which the place of honour must be awarded to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
bean;<a id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> indeed, some attempts have even been made to use it
for bread. Bean meal is known as “lomentum;” and, as is
the case with the meal of all leguminous plants, it adds considerably,
when mixed with flour, to the weight of the bread.
Beans are on sale at the present day for numerous purposes,
and are employed for feeding cattle, and man more particularly.
They are mixed, also, among most nations, with
wheat,<a id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> and panic more particularly, either whole or lightly
broken. In our ancient ceremonials, too, bean pottage<a id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> occupies
its place in the religious services of the gods. Beans are
mostly eaten together with other food, but it is generally
thought that they dull the senses, and cause sleepless nights
attended with dreams. Hence it is that the bean has been
condemned<a id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> by Pythagoras; though, according to some, the
reason for this denunciation was the belief which he entertained
that the souls of the dead are enclosed in the bean: it
is for this reason, too, that beans are used in the funereal banquets
of the Parentalia.<a id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> According to Varro, it is for a
similar cause that the Flamen abstains from eating beans: in
addition to which, on the blossom of the bean, there are certain
letters of ill omen to be found.</p>

<p>There are some peculiar religious usages connected with the
bean. It is the custom to bring home from the harvest a bean
by way of auspice, which, from that circumstance, has the
name of “referiva.”<a id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> In sales by public auction, too, it is
thought lucky to include a bean in the lot for sale. It is a
fact, too, that the bean is the only one among all the grains
that fills out at the increase of the moon,<a id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> however much it
may have been eaten away: it can never be thoroughly boiled
in sea-water, or indeed any other water that is salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>The bean is the first leguminous plant that is sown; that
being done before the setting of the Vergili&aelig;, in order that it
may pass the winter in the ground. Virgil<a id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> recommends that
it should be sown in spring, according to the usage of the parts
of Italy near the Padus: but most people prefer the bean that
has been sown early to that of only three months’ growth;
for, in the former case, the pods as well as the stalk afford a
most agreeable fodder for cattle. When in blossom more particularly,
the bean requires water; but after the blossom has
passed off, it stands in need of but very little. It fertilizes<a id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
the ground in which it has been sown as well as any manure;
hence it is that in the neighbourhood of Thessaly and Macedonia,
as soon as it begins to blossom, they turn up<a id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> the
ground.</p>

<p>The bean, too, grows wild in most countries, as in those
islands of the Northern Ocean, for instance, which for that
reason have been called by us the “Fabari&aelig;.”<a id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> In Mauritania,
also, it is found in a wild state in various parts, but so remarkably
hard that it will never become soft by boiling.</p>

<p>In Egypt there is a kind of bean<a id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> which grows upon a
thorny stalk; for which reason the crocodiles avoid it, being
apprehensive of danger to their eyes. This stalk is four
cubits in length, and its thickness, at the very most, that of
the finger: were it not for the absence of articulations in it,
it would resemble a soft reed in appearance. The head is
similar to that of the poppy, being of a rose colour: the beans
enclosed in this head are not above thirty in number; the
leaves are large, and the fruit is bitter and odoriferous. The
root, however, is highly esteemed by the natives as a food,
whether eaten raw or well boiled; it bears a strong resemblance
to that of the reed. This plant grows also in Syria
and Cilicia, and upon the banks of Lake Torone in Chalcidice.</p>

<p>Among the leguminous plants the lentil is sown in the
month of November, and the pea,<a id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> among the Greeks. The
lentil thrives best in a soil that is rather thin than rich, and
mostly stands in need of dry weather. There are two kinds
of lentil grown in Egypt; one of which is rounder and blacker
than the other, which has a peculiar shape of its own. The
name of this plant has been applied to various uses, and
among others has given origin to our word “lenticula.”<a id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> I
find it stated in some authors that a lentil diet is productive of
evenness of temper. The pea requires to be sown in a warm,
sunny spot, and is ill able to endure cold; hence in Italy and
the more rigorous climates, it is sown in the spring only, a light,
loose soil being chosen for the purpose.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_32"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 32.—THE SEVERAL KINDS OF CHICK-PEASE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The chick-pea<a id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> is naturally salt,<a id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> for which reason it is apt
to scorch the ground, and should only be sown after it has
been steeped a day in water. This plant presents considerable
differences in reference to size, colour,<a id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> form, and taste.
One variety resembles in shape a ram’s head, from which circumstance
it has received the name of “arietinum;” there
are both the white and the black arietinum. There is also the
columbine chick-pea, by some known as the “pea of Venus;”
it is white, round, and smooth, being smaller than the arietinum,
and is employed in the observances of the night festivals
or vigils. The chicheling vetch,<a id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> too, is a diminutive kind of
chick-pea, unequal and angular, like<a id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> the pea. The chick-pea
that is the sweetest in flavour is the one that bears the
closest resemblance to the fitch; the pod in the black and the
red kinds is more firmly closed than in the white ones.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_33"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 33.—THE KIDNEY-BEAN.</span></h3></div>

<p>The pod of the chick-pea is rounded, while in other leguminous
plants it is long and broad, like the seed which it
contains; in the pea, again, it is of a cylindrical form. In
the case of the kidney-bean<a id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> it is usual to eat the pod together
with the seed. This last may be sown in all kinds of soils
indifferently, between the ides of October<a id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> and the calends of
November.<a id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> As soon as ever the leguminous plants begin to
ripen, they ought to be plucked, for the pods will very soon
open and the seed fall out, in which case it is very difficult to
find: the same is the case, too, with the lupine. But before
we pass on to the lupine, it will be as well to make some mention
of the rape.<a id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 34. (13.)—THE RAPE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Latin writers have only treated of this plant in a cursory
manner, while those of Greece have considered it a little
more attentively; though even they have ranked it among the
garden plants. If, however, a methodical arrangement is to
be strictly observed, it should be spoken of immediately after
corn, or the bean, at all events; for next to these two productions,
there is no plant that is of more extensive use. For, in
the first place, all animals will feed upon it as it grows; and
it is far from being the least nutritious plant in the fields for
various kinds of birds, when boiled in water more particularly.
Cattle, too, are remarkably fond of the leaves of rape; and
the stalks and leaves, when in season, are no less esteemed
as a food for man than the sprouts of the cabbage;<a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> these,
too, when turned yellow and left to die in the barn, are even
more highly esteemed than<a id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> when green. As to the rape
itself, it will keep all the better if left in its mould, after which
it should be dried in the open air till the next crop is nearly
ripe, as a resource in case of scarcity. Next to those of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
grape and corn, this is the most profitable harvest of all for the
countries that lie beyond the Padus. The rape is by no means
difficult to please in soil, for it will grow almost anywhere,
indeed where nothing else can be sown. It readily derives
nutriment from fogs and hoar-frosts, and grows to a marvelous
size; I have seen them weighing upwards of forty pounds.<a id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
It is prepared for table among us in several ways, and is made
to keep till the next crop, its fermentation<a id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> being prevented by
preserving it in mustard. It is also tinted with no less than
six colours in addition to its own, and with purple even; indeed,
that which is used by us as food ought to be of no other
colour.<a id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>The Greeks have distinguished two principal species of rape,
the male and the female,<a id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> and have discovered a method of obtaining
them both from the same seed; for when it is sown thick,
or in a hard, cloggy soil, the produce will be male. The smaller
the seed the better it is in quality. There are three kinds of
rape in all; the first is broad and flat, the second of a spherical
shape, and the third, to which the name of “wild” rape<a id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
has been given, throws out a long root, similar in appearance
to a radish, with an angular, rough leaf, and an acrid juice,
which, if extracted about harvest, and mixed with a woman’s
milk, is good for cleansing the eyes and improving defective
sight. The colder the weather the sweeter they are, and the
larger, it is generally thought; heat makes them run to leaf.
The finest rape of all is that grown in the district of Nursia:
it is valued at as much as one sesterce<a id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> per pound, and, in
times of scarcity, two even. That of the next best quality is
produced on Mount Algidus.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_35"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 35.—THE TURNIP.</span></h3></div>

<p>The turnip<a id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> of Amiternum, which is pretty nearly of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
same nature as the rape, thrives equally well in a cold soil.
It is sown just before the calends of March,<a id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> four sextarii of
seed to the jugerum. The more careful growers recommend
that the ground should be turned up five times before putting
in the turnip, and four for rape, care being taken, in both
cases, to manure it well. Rape, they say, will thrive all the
better, if it is sown together with some chaff. They will
have it, too, that the sower ought to be stripped, and that he
should offer up a prayer while sowing, and say: “I sow this
for myself and for my neighbours.” The proper time for sowing
both kinds is the period that intervenes between the festivals<a id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
of the two divinities, Neptune and Vulcan. It is said,
too—and it is the result of very careful observation—that
these plants will thrive wonderfully well, if they are sown as
many days after the festival of Neptune as the moon was old
when the first snow fell the previous winter. They are sown
in spring as well, in warm and humid localities.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_36"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 36. (14.)—THE LUPINE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The lupine is the next among the leguminous plants that
is in extensive use, as it serves for food for man in common
with the hoofed quadrupeds. To prevent it from springing
out of the pod<a id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> while being gathered, and so lost, the best
plan is to gather it immediately after a shower. Of all the
seeds that are sown, there is not one of a more marvellous nature
than this, or more favoured by the earth. First of all,
it turns every day with the sun,<a id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> and shows the hour to the
husbandman, even though the weather should happen to be
cloudy and overcast. It blossoms, too, no less than three
times, and so attached is it to the earth, that it does not require
to be covered with the soil; indeed, this is the only seed
that does not require the earth to be turned up for sowing it.
It thrives more particularly on a sandy, dry, and even gravelly
soil; and requires no further care to be taken in its cultivation.
To such a degree is it attached to the earth, that even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
though left upon a soil thickly covered with brambles, it will
throw out a root amid the leaves and brakes, and so contrive
to reach the ground. We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> that the
soil of a field or vineyard is enriched by the growth of a
crop of lupines; indeed, so far is it from standing in need of
manure, that the lupines will act upon it as well as the very
best. It is the only seed that requires no outlay at all, so
much so, in fact, that there is no necessity to carry it even to the
spot where it is sown; for it may be sown the moment it is
brought from the threshing-floor:<a id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> and from the fact that it
falls from the pod of its own accord, it stands in need of no
one to scatter it.</p>

<p>This is<a id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> the very first grain sown and the last that is gathered,
both operations generally taking place in the month of September;
indeed, if this is not done before winter sets in, it is
liable to receive injury from the cold. And then, besides, it
may even be left with impunity to lie upon the ground, in case
showers should not immediately ensue and cover it in, it being
quite safe from the attacks of all animals, on account of its
bitter taste: still, however, it is mostly covered up in a slight
furrow. Among the thicker soils, it is attached to a red earth
more particularly. In order to enrich<a id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> this earth, it should be
turned up just after the third blossom; but where the soil is
sandy, after the second. Chalky and slimy soils are the only
ones that it has an aversion to; indeed, it will never come to
anything when sown in them. Soaked in warm water, it is
used as a food, too, for man. One modius is a sufficient meal
for an ox, and it is found to impart considerable vigour to
cattle; placed, too, upon the abdomen<a id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> of children, it acts as
a remedy in certain cases. It is an excellent plan to season
the lupine by smoking it; for when it is kept in a moist state,
maggots are apt to attack the germ, and render it useless for
reproduction. If cattle have eaten it off while in leaf, as a
matter of necessity it should be ploughed in as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 37. (15.)—THE VETCH.</span></h3></div>

<p>The vetch,<a id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> too, enriches the soil, and its cultivation entails
no labour on the agriculturist. It is sown after the
ground has been but once turned up, and requires neither hoeing
nor manuring; nothing at all, indeed, except harrowing.
There are three periods for sowing it; the first is about the
setting of Arcturus, when it is intended for feeding cattle
in the month of December, while in the blade; this crop, too,
is the best of all for seed, for, although grazed upon, it will
bear just as well. The second crop is sown in the month of
January, and the last in March; this last being the best crop
for fodder. Of all the seeds this is the one that thrives best
in a dry soil; still, however, it manifests no repugnance to
a shaded locality. This grain, if gathered when quite ripe,
produces a chaff superior to that of any other. If sown near
vines supported by trees, the vetch will draw away the juices
from the vines, and make them languid.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the fitch,<a id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> too, is attended with no difficulty.
It requires weeding, however, more than the vetch.
Like it, the fitch has certain medicinal<a id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> properties; for we
find the fact still kept in remembrance by some letters of his,
that the late Emperor Augustus was cured by its agency. Five
modii will sow as much ground as a yoke of oxen can plough
in a day. If sown in the month of March,<a id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> it is injurious,
they say, to oxen: and when sown in autumn, it is apt to produce
head-ache. If, however, it is put in the ground at the
beginning of spring, it will be productive of no bad results.</p>

fingers in depth; the less the pains that are bestowed upon it
the better it will thrive—a singular fact that there should be
anything that profits from neglect. The kinds, however, that
are known as “secale” and “farrago” require harrowing only.</p>

is only employed to avert positive famine. It is prolific, but
has a straw of remarkable thinness; it is also black and
sombre-looking, but weighs extremely heavy. Spelt is mixed
with this grain to modify its bitterness,<a id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and even then it is
very disagreeable to the stomach. It will grow upon any soil,

<p>Farrago, a mixture made of the refuse of “far,” or spelt, is
sown very thick, the vetch being sometimes mingled with it;
in Africa, this mixture is sometimes made with barley. All
these mixtures, however, are only intended for cattle, and the
same is the case with the cracca,<a id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> a degenerate kind of leguminous

this grain, that they will never leave the place where it has
been given to them.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_42"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 42.—OCINUM: ERVILIA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the ancients there was a sort of fodder, to which
Cato<a id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> gives the name of “ocinum;” it was employed by them
to stop scouring in oxen. This was a mixture of various kinds
of fodder, cut green before the frosts came on. Mamilius Sura,
however, explains the term differently, and says that ten modii
of beans, two of vetches, and the same quantity of ervilia,<a id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
were mixed and sown in autumn on a jugerum of land. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
states, also, that it is a still better plan to mix some Greek oats<a id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a>
with it, the grain of which never falls to the ground; this mixture,
according to him, was ocinum, and was usually sown as a
food for oxen. Varro<a id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> informs us that it received its name
on account of the celerity with which it springs up, from the
Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠκέως</span>, “quickly.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_43"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 43.—LUCERNE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Lucerne<a id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> is by nature an exotic to Greece even, it having
been first introduced into that country from Media,<a id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> at the time
of the Persian wars with King Darius; still it deserves to be
mentioned among the very first of these productions. So superior
are its qualities, that a single sowing will last more
than thirty<a id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> years. It resembles trefoil in appearance, but the
stalk and leaves are articulated. The longer it grows in the
stalk, the narrower is the leaf. Amphilochus has devoted a
whole book to this subject and the cytisus.<a id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> The ground in
which it is sown, being first cleaned and cleared of stones, is
turned up in the autumn, after which it is ploughed and harrowed.
It is then harrowed a second and a third time, at intervals
of five days; after which manure is laid upon it. This
seed requires either a soil that is dry, but full of nutriment, or
else a well-watered one. After the ground has been thus prepared,
the seed is put in in the month of May;<a id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> for if sown
earlier, it is in danger from the frosts. It is necessary to sow
the seed very thick, so that all the ground may be occupied,
and no room left for weeds to shoot up in the intervals; a
result which may be secured by sowing twenty modii to the
jugerum. The seed must be stirred at once with the rake, to
prevent the sun from scorching it, and it should be covered
over with earth as speedily as possible. If the soil is naturally
damp or weedy, the lucerne will be overpowered, and the spot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
degenerate into an ordinary pasture; it is necessary, therefore,
directly the crop is an inch in height, to disengage it from
all weeds, by hand, in preference to the weeding-hook.</p>

<p>It is cut when it is just beginning to flower, and this is repeated
as often as it throws out new blossoms; which happens
mostly six<a id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> times in the year, and four at the very least.
Care should be taken to prevent it from running to seed, as it
is much more valuable as fodder, up to the third year. It
should be hoed in the spring, and cleared of all other plants;
and in the third year the surface should be well worked with
the weeding-hook. By adopting this method, the weeds will
be effectually destroyed, though without detriment to the lucerne,
in consequence of the depth of its roots. If the weeds
should happen to get ahead of it, the only remedy is to turn it
up repeatedly with the plough, until the roots of the weeds are
thoroughly destroyed. This fodder should never be given to
cattle to satiety, otherwise it may be necessary to let blood; it
is best, too, when used while green. When dry, it becomes
tough and ligneous, and falls away at last into a thin, useless
dust. As to the cytisus, which also occupies the very foremost
rank among the fodders, we have already spoken<a id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> of it at sufficient
length when describing the shrubs. It remains for us
now to complete our account of all the cereals, and we shall
here devote a portion of it to the diseases to which they are
subject.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_44"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 44. (17.)—THE DISEASES OF GRAIN: THE OAT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The foremost feature of disease in wheat is the oat.<a id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Barley,
too, will degenerate into the oat; so much so, in fact, that the
oat has become an equivalent for corn; for the people of Germany
are in the habit of sowing it, and make their porridge of
nothing else. This degeneracy is owing more particularly to
humidity of soil and climate; and a second cause is a weakness in
the seed, the result of its being retained too long in the ground
before it makes its appearance above it. The same, too, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
be the consequence, if the seed is decayed when put in the
ground. This may be known, however, the moment it makes
its appearance, from which it is quite evident that the defect
lies in the root. There is another form of disease, too, which
closely resembles the oat, and which supervenes when the
grain, already developed to its full size, but not ripe, is struck
by a noxious blast, before it has acquired its proper body and
strength; in this case, the seed pines away in the ear, by a
kind of abortion, as it were, and totally disappears.</p>

<p>The wind is injurious to wheat and barley, at three<a id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> periods
of the year in particular: when they are in blossom, directly
the blossom has passed off, and just as the seed is beginning to
ripen. In this last case, the grain wastes away, while in the
two former ones it is prevented from being developed. Gleams
of sunshine, every now and then, from the midst of clouds,
are injurious to corn. Maggots, too, breed<a id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> in the roots, when
the rains that follow the seed-time are succeeded by a sudden
heat, which encloses the humidity in the ground. Maggots
make their appearance,<a id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> also, in the grain, when the ear ferments
through heat succeeding a fall of rain. There is a small
beetle, too, known by the name of “cantharis,”<a id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> which eats
away the blade. All these insects die, however, as soon as
their nutriment fails them. Oil,<a id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> pitch, and grease are prejudicial
to grain, and care should be taken not to let them come
in contact with the seed that is sown. Rain is only beneficial
to grain while in the blade; it is injurious to wheat and barley
while they are in blossom, but is not detrimental to the leguminous
plants, with the exception of the chick-pea. When
grain is beginning to ripen, rain is injurious, and to barley in
particular. There is a white grass<a id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> that grows in the fields,
very similar to panic in appearance, but fatal to cattle. As to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
darnel,<a id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> the tribulus,<a id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> the thistle,<a id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> and the burdock,<a id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> I can
consider them, no more than the bramble, among the maladies
that attack the cereals, but rather as so many pests inflicted on
the earth. Mildew,<a id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> a malady resulting from the inclemency
of the weather, and equally attacking the vine<a id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> and corn, is
in no degree less injurious. It attacks corn most frequently in
localities which are exposed to dews, and in vallies which have
not a thorough draught for the wind; windy and elevated
spots, on the other hand, are totally exempt from it. Another
evil, again, in corn, is over-luxuriance, when it falls to the
ground beneath the weight<a id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> of the grain. One evil, however,
to which all crops in common, the chick-pea even, are exposed,
is the attacks of the caterpillar, when the rain, by washing
away the natural saltness of the vegetation, makes it<a id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> all the
more tempting for its sweetness.</p>

<p>There is a certain plant,<a id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> too, which kills the chick-pea and
the fitch, by twining around them; the name of it is “orobanche.”
In a similar manner, also, wheat is attacked by
darnel,<a id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> barley by a long-stalked plant, called “&aelig;gilops,”<a id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> and
the lentil by an axe-leafed grass, to which, from the resemblance<a id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
of the leaf, the Greeks have given the name of “pelecinon.”
All these plants, too, kill the others by entwining
around them. In the neighbourhood of Philippi, there is a
plant known as ateramon,<a id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> which grows in a rich soil, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
kills the bean, after it has been exposed, while wet, to the
blasts of a certain wind: when it grows in a thin, light soil,
this plant is called “teramon.” The seed of darnel is extremely
minute, and is enclosed in a prickly husk. If introduced
into bread, it will speedily produce vertigo; and it is
said that in Asia and Greece, the bath-keepers, when they want
to disperse a crowd of people, throw this seed upon burning
coals. The phalangium, a diminutive insect of the spider
genus,<a id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> breeds in the fitch, if the winter happens to be wet.
Slugs, too, breed in the vetch, and sometimes a tiny snail makes
its way out of the ground, and eats it away in a most singular
manner.</p>

<p>These are pretty nearly all the maladies to which grain is
subject.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_45"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 45.—THE BEST REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF GRAIN.</span></h3></div>

<p>The best remedy for these maladies, so long as grain is in
the blade, is the weeding-hook, and, at the moment of sowing,
ashes.<a id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> As to those diseases which develope themselves in the
seed and about the root, with due care precautions may be effectually
employed against them. It is generally supposed that
if seed has been first steeped in wine,<a id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> it will be less exposed
to disease. Virgil<a id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> recommends that beans should be drenched
with nitre and amurca of olives; and he says that if this is
done, they will be all the larger. Some persons, again, are of
opinion, that they will grow of increased size, if the seed is
steeped for three days before it is sown in a solution of urine
and water. If the ground, too, is hoed three times, a modius
of beans in the pod, they say, will yield not less than a modius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of shelled<a id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> beans. Other seeds, again, it is said, will be
exempt from the attacks of maggots, if bruised cypress<a id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> leaves
are mixed with them, or if they are sown just at the moon’s
conjunction. Many persons, for the more effectual protection
of millet, recommend that a bramble-frog should be carried at
night round the field before the hoeing is done, and then buried
in an earthen vessel in the middle of it. If this is done, they
say, neither sparrows nor worms will attack the crop. The
frog, however, must be disinterred before the millet is cut; for
if this is neglected, the produce will be bitter. It is pretended,
too, that all seeds which have been touched by the shoulders
of a mole are remarkably productive.</p>

<p>Democritus recommends that all seeds before they are sown
should be steeped in the juice of the herb known as “aizo&uuml;m,”<a id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
which grows on tiles or shingles, and is known to us by the
Latin name of “sedum” or “digitellum.”<a id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> If blight prevails,
or if worms are found adhering to the roots, it is a very
common remedy to sprinkle the plants with pure amurca of
olives without salt, and then to hoe the ground. If, however,
the crop should be beginning to joint, it should be stubbed at
once, for fear lest the weeds should gain the upper hand. I
know for certain<a id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> that flights of starlings and sparrows, those
pests to millet and panic, are effectually driven away by means
of a certain herb, the name of which is unknown to me, being
buried at the four corners of the field: it is a wonderful thing
to relate, but in such case not a single bird will enter it. Mice
are kept away by the ashes of a weasel or a cat being steeped
in water and then thrown upon the seed, or else by using the
water in which the body of a weasel or a cat has been boiled.
The odour, however, of these animals makes itself perceived
in the bread even; for which reason it is generally thought a
better plan to steep the seed in ox-gall.<a id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> As for mildew,
that greatest curse of all to corn, if branches of laurel are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
fixed in the ground, it will pass away from the field into the
leaves of the laurel. Over-luxuriance in corn is repressed by
the teeth of cattle,<a id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> but only while it is in the blade; in which
case, if depastured upon ever so often, no injury to it when
in the ear will be the result. If the ear, too, is once cut off,
the grain, it is well known, will assume a larger<a id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> form, but
will be hollow within and worthless, and if sown, will come
to nothing.</p>

<p>At Babylon, however, they cut the blade twice, and then
let the cattle pasture on it a third time, for otherwise it would
run to nothing but leaf. Even then, however, so fertile is the
soil, that it yields fifty, and, indeed, with care, as much as a
hundred, fold. Nor is the cultivation of it attended with any
difficulty, the only object being to let the ground be under
water as long as possible, in order that the extreme richness
and exuberance of the soil may be modified. The Euphrates,
however, and the Tigris do not deposit a slime, in the same
way that the Nilus does in Egypt, nor does the soil produce
vegetation spontaneously; but still, so great is the fertility,
that, although the seed is only trodden in with the foot, a crop
springs up spontaneously the following year. So great a difference
in soils as this, reminds me that I ought to take this
opportunity of specifying those which are the best adapted
for the various kinds of grain.</p>

<p>This, then, is the opinion expressed by Cato<a id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> on the subject:
“In a dense and fertile soil wheat should be sown: but if the
locality is subject to fogs, rape, radishes, millet, and panic.
Where the land<a id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> is cold and moist, sowing should be commenced
earlier; but where it is hot, at a later period. In a
red, black, or gravelly soil, provided it is not watery, lupines
should be sown; but in chalk, red earth, or a watery soil,
spelt.<a id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> Where a locality is dry, free from weeds, and not
overshadowed, wheat should be put in; and where the soil is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
strong and powerful, beans. Vetches should be grown in a
soil as free from water and weeds as possible; while wheat
and winter wheat are best adapted to an open, elevated locality,
fully exposed to the warmth of the sun. The lentil
thrives best in a meagre, red earth, free from weeds. Barley is
equally suited for fallow land and for a soil that is not intended
to be fallow, and three-month wheat, for a soil upon which a
crop of ordinary wheat would never ripen, but strong enough
to bear.”</p>

<p>The following, too, is sound advice:<a id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Those plants should
be sown in a thin soil which do not stand in need of much
nutriment, the cytisus, for instance, and such of the leguminous
plants, with the exception of the chick-pea, as are taken up
by the roots and not cut. From this mode of gathering them—“legere”—the
legumina derive their name. Where it is a
rich earth, those plants should be grown which require a
greater proportion of nutriment, coleworts for instance, wheat,
winter-wheat, and flax. The result, then, will be, that a
light soil will be given to barley—the root of that grain standing
in need of less nutriment—while a more dense, though
easily-worked soil, will be assigned to wheat. In humid localities
spelt should be sown in preference to wheat; but where
the soil is of moderate temperature, either wheat or barley
may be grown. Declivities produce a stronger growth of
wheat, but in smaller quantities. Spelt and winter-wheat
adopt a moist, cretaceous soil in preference to any other.</p>

<p>(18.) The only occasion on which there ever was a prodigy
connected with grain, at least that I am aware of, was in the
consulship of P. &AElig;lius and Cneius Cornelius, the year<a id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> in
which Hannibal was vanquished: on that occasion, we find
it stated, corn was seen growing upon trees.<a id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_47"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 47.—THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF CULTIVATION EMPLOYED
BY VARIOUS NATIONS.</span></h3></div>

<p>As we have now spoken at sufficient length of the several
varieties of grain and soil, we shall proceed to treat of the
methods adopted in tilling the ground, taking care, in the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
first place, to make mention of the peculiar facilities enjoyed
by Egypt in this respect. In that country, performing the
duties of the husbandman, the Nile begins to overflow, as
already stated,<a id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> immediately after the summer solstice or the
new moon, gradually at first, but afterwards with increased
impetuosity, as long as the sun remains in the sign of Leo.
When the sun has passed into Virgo, the impetuosity of the
overflow begins to slacken, and when he has entered Libra the
river subsides. Should it not have exceeded twelve cubits in
its overflow, famine is the sure result; and this is equally the
case if it should chance to exceed sixteen; for the higher it
has risen, the more slowly it subsides, and, of course, the seed-time
is impeded in proportion. It was formerly a very general
belief that immediately upon the subsiding of the waters the
Egyptians were in the habit of driving herds of swine over
the ground, for the purpose of treading the seed into the moist
soil—and it is my own impression that this was done in ancient
times. At the present day even, the operation is not attended
with much greater labour. It is well known, however, that
the seed is first laid upon the slime that has been left by the
river on its subsidence, and then ploughed in; this being done
at the beginning of November. After this is done, a few persons
are employed in stubbing, an operation known there as
“botanismos.” The rest of the labourers, however, have no
occasion to visit the land again till a little before the calends
of April,<a id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> and then it is with the reaping-hook. The harvest
is completed in the month of May. The stem is never so
much as a cubit in length, as there is a stratum of sand beneath
the slime, from which last alone the grain receives its
support. The best wheat of all is that of the region of
Thebais, Egypt<a id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> being of a marshy character.</p>

<p>The method adopted at Seleucia in Babylonia is very similar
to this, but the fertility there is still greater, owing to the
overflow of the Euphrates and Tigris,<a id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> the degree of irrigation
being artificially modified in those parts. In Syria, too,
the furrows are made extremely light, while in many parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Italy, again, it takes as many as eight oxen to pant and blow
at a single plough. All the operations of agriculture, but this
in particular, should he regulated by the oracular precept—“Remember
that every locality has its own tendencies.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_48"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 48.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PLOUGHS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Ploughs are of various kinds. The coulter<a id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> is the iron part
that cuts up the dense earth before it is broken into pieces, and
traces beforehand by its incisions the future furrows, which the
share, reversed,<a id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> is to open out with its teeth. Another kind—the
common plough-share—is nothing more than a lever, furnished
with a pointed beak; while another variety, which is only
used in light, easy soils, does not present an edge projecting from
the share-beam throughout, but only a small point at the extremity.
In a fourth kind again, this point is larger and formed
with a cutting edge; by the agency of which implement, it
both cleaves the ground, and, with the sharp edges at the sides,
cuts up the weeds by the roots. There has been invented, at a
comparatively recent period, in that part of Gaul<a id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> known as
Rh&aelig;tia, a plough with the addition of two small wheels, and
known by the name of “plaumorati.”<a id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> The extremity of the
share in this has the form of a spade: it is only used, however,
for sowing in cultivated lands, and upon soils which are nearly
fallow. The broader the plough-share, the better it is for
turning up the clods of earth. Immediately after ploughing,
the seed is put into the ground, and then harrows<a id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> with long
teeth are drawn over it. Lands which have been sown in this
way require no hoeing, but two or three pairs of oxen are employed
in ploughing. It is a fair estimate to consider that a
single yoke of oxen can work forty jugera of land in the year,
where the soil is light, and thirty where it is stubborn.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_49"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 49. (19.)—THE MODE OF PLOUGHING.</span></h3></div>

<p>In ploughing, the most rigid attention should be paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
oracular precepts given by Cato<a id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> on the subject. “What is
the essence of good tillage? Good ploughing. What is the
second point? Ploughing again. What is the third point?
Manuring. Take care not to make crooked furrows. Be
careful to plough at the proper time.” In warm localities it
is necessary to open the ground immediately after the winter
solstice, but where it is cold, directly after the vernal equinox:
this, too, should be done sooner in dry districts than in wet ones,
in a dense soil than a loose one, in a rich land than a meagre
one. In countries where the summers are hot and oppressive,
the soil cretaceous or thin, it is the best plan to plough between
the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. Where, on
the other hand, the heat is moderate, with frequent falls of rain,
and the soil rich and full of vegetation, the ploughing should
be done during the prevalence of the heat. A deep, heavy
soil, again, should be ploughed in winter; but one that is very
thin and dry, only just before putting in the seed.</p>

<p>Tillage, too, has its own particular rules<a id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>—Never touch the
ground while it is wet and cloggy; plough with all your might;
loosen the ground before you begin to plough. This method
has its advantages, for by turning up the clods the roots of the
weeds are killed. Some persons recommend that in every case
the ground should be turned up immediately after the vernal
equinox. Land that has been ploughed once in spring, from
that circumstance has the name of “vervactum.”<a id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> This, too,
is equally necessary in the case of fallow land, by which term
is meant land that is sown only in alternate years. The oxen
employed in ploughing should be harnessed as tightly as possible,
to make them plough with their heads up; attention
paid to this point will prevent them from galling the neck. If
it is among trees and vines that you are ploughing, the oxen
should be muzzled, to prevent them from eating off the tender
buds. There should be a small bill-hook, too, projecting from
the plough-tail, for the purpose of cutting up the roots; this
plan being preferable to that of turning them up with the share,
and so straining the oxen. When ploughing, finish the furrow
at one spell, and never stop to take breath in the middle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fair day’s work to plough one jugerum, for the first
time, nine inches in depth; and the second time, one jugerum
and a half—that is to say, if it is an easy soil. If this, however,
is not the case, it will take a day to turn up half a jugerum
for the first time, and a whole jugerum the second; for
Nature has set limits to the powers of animals even. The
furrows should be made, in every case, first in a straight line,
and then others should be drawn, crossing them obliquely.<a id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
Upon a hill-side the furrows are drawn transversely<a id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> only,
the point of the share inclining upwards at one moment and
downwards<a id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> at another. Man, too, is so well fitted for labour,
that he is able to supply the place of the ox even; at all events,
it is without the aid of that animal that the mountain tribes
plough, having only the hoe to help them.<a id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>The ploughman, unless he stoops to his work, is sure to prevaricate,<a id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
a word which has been transferred to the Forum, as
a censure upon those who transgress—at any rate, let those be
on their guard against it, where it was first employed. The
share should be cleaned every now and then with a stick pointed
with a scraper. The ridges that are left between every two
furrows, should not be left in a rough state, nor should large
clods be left protruding from the ground. A field is badly
ploughed that stands in need of harrowing after the seed is in;
but the work has been properly done, when it is impossible to
say in which direction the share has gone. It is a good plan,
too, to leave a channel every now and then, if the nature of the
spot requires it, by making furrows of a larger size, to draw off
the water into the drains.</p>

<p>(20.) After the furrows have been gone over again transversely,
the clods are broken, where there is a necessity for it, with
either the harrow or the rake;<a id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> and this operation is repeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
after the seed has been put in. This last harrowing is done,
where the usage of the locality will allow of it, with either a
toothed harrow, or else a plank attached to the plough. This operation
of covering in the seed is called “lirare,” from which is
derived the word “deliratio.”<a id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> it is generally thought,
intends to recommend sowing after <i>four</i> ploughings, in the
passage where he says that land will bear the best crop, which
has twice felt the sun and twice the cold. Where the soil is
dense, as in most parts of Italy, it is a still better plan to go
over the ground five times before sowing; in Etruria, they give
the land as many as nine ploughings first. The bean, however,
and the vetch may be sown with no risk, without turning up
the land at all; which, of course, is so much labour saved.</p>

<p>We must not here omit to mention still one other method of
ploughing, which the devastations of warfare have suggested
in Italy that lies beyond the Padus. The Salassi,<a id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> when
ravaging the territories which lay at the foot of the Alps, made
an attempt to lay waste the crops of panic and millet that were
just appearing above the ground. Finding, however, that
Nature resisted all their endeavours, they passed the plough
over the ground, the result of which was that the crops were
more abundant than ever; and this it was that first taught us
the method of ploughing in, expressed by the word “artrare,”
otherwise “aratrare,” in my opinion the original form. This
is done either just as the stem begins to develope itself, or else
when it has put forth as many as two or three leaves. Nor
must we withhold from the reader a more recent method, which
was discovered the year but one before this,<a id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> in the territory
of the Treviri. The crops having been nipped by the extreme
severity of the winter, the people sowed the land over again
in the month of March, and had a most abundant harvest.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to a description of the peculiar methods
employed in cultivating each description of grain.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_50"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 50. (21.)—THE METHODS OF HARROWING, STUBBING, AND
HOEING, EMPLOYED FOR EACH DESCRIPTION OF GRAIN. THE
USE OF THE HARROW.</span></h3></div>

<p>For winter wheat, spelt, wheat, zea,<a id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> and barley, harrow,
hoe and stub upon the days which will be mentioned<a id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> in the
sequel. A single hand per jugerum will be quite enough for
any one of these kinds of grain. The operation of hoeing
loosens the ground in spring when it has been hardened and
saddened by the rigours of the winter, and admits the early
sun to the interior. In hoeing, every care must be taken not
to go beneath the roots of the corn; in the case of wheat, zea,
and barley, it is best to give a couple of hoeings. Stubbing,<a id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
when the crop is just beginning to joint, cleanses it of all
noxious weeds, disengages the roots of the corn, and liberates
the growing blade from the clods. Among the leguminous
plants, the chick-pea requires the same treatment that spelt
does. The bean requires no stubbing, being quite able of itself
to overpower all weeds; the lupine, too, is harrowed only.
Millet and panic are both harrowed and hoed; but this operation
is never repeated, and they do not require stubbing.
Fenugreek and the kidney-bean require harrowing only.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of ground, the extreme fertility of
which obliges the grower to comb down the crops while in the
blade—this is done with a sort of harrow<a id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> armed with pointed
iron teeth—and even then he is obliged to depasture cattle upon
them. When, however, the blade has been thus eaten down,
it stands in need of hoeing to restore it to its former vigour.</p>

<p>But in Bactria, and at Cyren&aelig; in Africa, all this trouble has
been rendered quite unnecessary by the indulgent benignity of
the climate, and after the seed is in, the owner has no occasion
to return to the field till the time has come for getting in the
harvest. In those parts the natural dryness of the soil prevents
noxious weeds from springing up, and, aided by the night dews
alone, the soil supplies its nutriment to the grain. Virgil<a id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
recommends that the ground should be left to enjoy repose every
other year; and this, no doubt, if the extent of the farm will
admit of it, is the most advantageous plan. If, however, circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
will not allow of it, spelt should be sown upon the
ground that has been first cropped with lupines, vetches, or
beans; for all these have a tendency to make the soil more
fertile. We ought to remark here more particularly, that here
and there certain plants are sown for the benefit of others,
although, as already stated in the preceding Book,<a id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> not to
repeat the same thing over again, they are of little value themselves.
But it is the nature of each soil that is of the greatest
importance.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_51"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 51. (22.)—EXTREME FERTILITY OF SOIL.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is a city of Africa, situate in the midst of the sands
as you journey towards the Syrtes and Great Leptis, Tacape<a id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a>
by name. The soil there, which is always well-watered, enjoys
a degree of fertility quite marvellous. Through this
spot, which extends about three miles each way, a spring of
water flows—in great abundance it is true—but still, it is only
at certain hours that its waters are distributed among the inhabitants.
Here, beneath a palm of enormous size, grows the
olive, beneath the olive the fig, beneath the fig, again, the pomegranate,
beneath the pomegranate the vine, and beneath the
vine we find sown, first wheat, then the leguminous plants, and
after them garden herbs—all in the same year, and all growing
beneath another’s shade. Four cubits square of this same
ground—the cubit<a id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> being measured with the fingers contracted
and not extended—sell at the rate of four denarii.<a id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> But what
is more surprising than all, is the fact that here the vine bears
twice, and that there are two vintages in the year. Indeed,
if the fertility of the soil were not distributed in this way
among a multitude of productions, each crop would perish from
its own exuberance: as it is, there is no part of the year that
there is not some crop or other being gathered in; and yet, it
is a well-known fact, that the people do nothing at all to promote
this fruitfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>There are very considerable differences, too, in the nature of
water, as employed for the purposes of irrigation. In the
province of Gallia Narbonensis there is a famous fountain,
Orge by name; within it there grow plants which are sought
for with such eagerness by the cattle, that they will plunge
over head into the water to get at them; it is a well ascertained<a id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
fact, however, that these plants, though growing in the water,
receive their nutriment only from the rains that fall. It is
as well then that every one should be fully acquainted with the
nature, not only of the soil, but of the water too.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_52"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 52. (23.)—THE METHOD OF SOWING MORE THAN ONCE
IN THE YEAR.</span></h3></div>

<p>If the soil is of that nature which we have already<a id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> spoken
of as “tender,”<a id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> after a crop of barley has been grown upon
it, millet may be sown, and after the millet has been got in,
rape. In succession to these, again, barley may be put in, or
else wheat, as in Campania; and it will be quite enough, in
such case, to plough the ground when the seed is sown. There
is another rotation again—when the ground has been cropped
with spelt,<a id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> it should lie fallow the four winter months; after
which, spring beans should be put in, to keep it occupied till
the time comes for cropping it with winter beans. Where the
soil is too rich, it may lie fallow one year, care being taken after
sowing it with corn to crop it with the leguminous plants the
third year.<a id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> Where, on the other hand, it is too thin, the land
should lie fallow up to the third year even. Some persons recommend
that corn should never be sown except in land which
has lain fallow the year before.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_53"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 53.—THE MANURING OF LAND.</span></h3></div>

<p>The proper method of manuring is here a very important
subject for consideration—we have already treated of it at
some length in the preceding Book.<a id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> The only point that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
universally agreed upon is, that we must never sow without
first manuring the ground; although in this respect even there
are certain rules to be observed. Millet, panic, rape, and turnips
should never be sown in any but a manured soil. If, on
the other hand, the land is not manured, sow wheat there in
preference to barley. The same, too, with fallow lands;
though in these it is generally recommended that beans should
be sown. It should be remembered, however, that wherever
beans are sown, the land should have been manured at as recent
a period as possible. If it is intended to crop ground in
autumn, care must be taken to plough in manure in the month
of September, just after rain has fallen. In the same way,
too, if it is intended to sow in spring, the manure should be
spread in the winter. It is the rule to give eighteen cart-loads
of manure to each jugerum, and to spread it well before
ploughing it in,<a id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> or sowing the seed.<a id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> If this manuring,
however, is omitted, it will be requisite to spread the land
with aviary dust just before hoeing is commenced. To clear
up any doubts with reference to this point, I would here observe
that the fair price for a cart-load of manure is one
denarius; where, too, sheep furnish one cart-load, the larger
cattle should furnish ten:<a id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> unless this result is obtained, it
is a clear proof that the husbandman has littered his cattle
badly.</p>

<p>There are some persons who are of opinion that the best
method of manuring land is to pen sheep there, with nets
erected to prevent them from straying. If land is not manured,
it will get chilled; but if, on the other hand, it is over-manured,
it becomes burnt up: it is a much better plan, too,
to manure little and often than in excess. The warmer the
soil is by nature, the less manure it requires.</p>

<p>The best seed of all is that which is of the last year’s growth.
That which is two years old is inferior, and three the worst of all—beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
that, it is unproductive.<a id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> The same definite rule
which applies to one kind of seed is applicable to them all:
the seed which falls to the bottom<a id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> on the threshing-floor,
should be reserved for sowing, for being the most weighty it
is the best in quality: there is no better method, in fact, of
ascertaining its quality. The grains of those ears which have
intervals between the seed should be rejected. The best grain
is that which has a reddish hue,<a id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and which, when broken
between the teeth, presents the same<a id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> colour; that which has
more white within is of inferior quality. It is a well-known
fact that some lands require more seed than others, from which
circumstance first arose a superstition that exists among the
peasantry; it is their belief that when the ground demands the
seed with greater avidity than usual, it is famished, and devours
the grain. It is consistent with reason to put in the seed
where the soil is humid sooner than elsewhere, to prevent the
grain from rotting in the rain: on dry spots it should be sown
later, and just before the fall of a shower, so that it may not
have to lie long without germinating and so come to nothing.
When the seed is put in early it should be sown thick, as it is
a considerable time before it germinates; but when it is put
in later, it should be sown thinly, to prevent it from being suffocated.
There is a certain degree of skill, too, required in
scattering the seed evenly; to ensure this, the hand must keep
time<a id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> with the step, moving always with the right foot.
There are certain persons, also, who have a secret method<a id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> of
their own, having been born<a id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> with a happy hand which imparts
fruitfulness to the grain. Care should be taken not to
sow seed in a warm locality which has been grown in a cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
one, nor should the produce of an early soil be sown in a late
one. Those who give advice to the contrary have quite misapplied
their pains.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_55"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 55.—WHAT QUANTITY OF EACH KIND OF GRAIN IS REQUISITE
FOR SOWING A JUGERUM.</span></h3></div>

<p><a id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>
In a soil of middling quality, the proper proportion of seed
is five modii of wheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, ten of
spelt or of seed-wheat—that being the name which we have
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> as being given to one kind of wheat—six of
barley, one-fifth more of beans than of wheat, twelve of
vetches, three of chick-pease, chicheling vetches, and pease,
ten of lupines, three of lentils—(these last, however, it is said,
must be sown with dry manure)—six of fitches, six of fenugreek,
four of kidney-beans, twenty of hay grass,<a id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> and four
sextarii of millet and panic. Where the soil is rich, the proportion
must be greater, where it is thin, less.<a id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>There is another distinction, too, to be made; where the
soil is dense, cretaceous, or moist, there should be six modii of
wheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, but where the land is
loose, dry, and prolific, four will be enough. A meagre soil,
too, if the crop is not very thinly sown, will produce a diminutive,
empty ear. Rich lands give a number of stalks to each
grain, and yield a thick crop from only a light sowing. The
result, then, is, that from four to six modii must be sown,
according to the nature of the soil; though there are some
who make it a rule that five modii is the proper proportion for
sowing, neither more nor less, whether it is a densely-planted
locality, a declivity, or a thin, meagre soil. To this subject
bears reference an oracular precept which never can be too
carefully observed<a id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>—“Don’t rob the harvest.”<a id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> Attius, in his
Praxidicus,<a id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> has added that the proper time for sowing is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
when the moon is in Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, and Aquarius.
Zoroaster says it should be done when the sun has passed twelve
degrees of Scorpio, and the moon is in Taurus.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_56"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 56.—THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING.</span></h3></div>

<p>We now come to a subject which has been hitherto deferred
by us, and which requires our most careful attention—the
proper times for sowing. This is a question that depends in
a very great degree upon the stars; and I shall therefore make
it my first care to set forth all the opinions that have been
written in reference to the subject. Hesiod, the first writer
who has given any precepts upon agriculture, speaks of one
period only for sowing—the setting of the Vergili&aelig;: but then
he wrote in Bœotia, a country of Hellas, where, as we have
already stated,<a id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> they are still in the habit of sowing at that
period.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed by the most correct writers, that with
the earth, as with the birds and quadrupeds, there are certain
impulses for reproduction; and the epoch for this is fixed by
the Greeks at the time when the earth is warm and moist.
Virgil<a id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> says that wheat and spelt should be sown at the setting
of the Vergili&aelig;, barley between the autumnal equinox and
the winter solstice, and vetches,<a id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> kidney-beans, and lentils at
the setting of Bo&ouml;tes:<a id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> it is of great importance, therefore,
to ascertain the exact days of the rising and setting of these
constellations, as well as of the others. There are some, again,
who recommend the sowing to be done before the setting of
the Vergili&aelig;, but only in a dry soil, and in those provinces
where the weather is hot; for the seed, they say,<a id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> if put in the
ground will keep, there being no moisture to spoil it, and
within a single day after the next fall of rain, will make its
appearance above ground. Others, again, are of opinion that
sowing should begin about seven days after the setting of the
Vergili&aelig;, a period which is mostly followed by rain. Some
think that cold soils should be sown immediately after the
autumnal equinox, and a warm soil later, so that the blade
may not put forth too luxuriantly before winter.</p>

<p>It is universally agreed, however, that the sowing should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
not be done about the period of the winter solstice; for this
very good reason—the winter seeds, if put in before the
winter solstice, will make their appearance above ground on
the seventh day, whereas, if they are sown just after it, they
will hardly appear by the fortieth. There are some, however,
who begin very early, and have a saying to justify their doing
so, to the effect that if seed sown too early often disappoints,
seed put in too late always does so. On the other hand, again,
there are some who maintain that it is better to sow in
spring than in a bad autumn; and they say that if they find
themselves obliged to sow in spring, they would choose the
period that intervenes between the prevalence of the west
winds<a id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> and the vernal equinox. Some persons, however, take
no notice of the celestial phenomena, and only regulate their
movements by the months. In spring they put in flax, the
oat, and the poppy, up to the feast of the Quinquatria,<a id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> as we
find done at the present day by the people of Italy beyond the
Padus. There, too, they sow beans and winter-wheat in the
month of November, and spelt at the end of September, up
to the ides of October:<a id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> others, however, sow this last after
the ides of October, as late as the calends of November.<a id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>The persons who do this take no notice, consequently, of the
phenomena of Nature, while others, again, lay too much stress
upon them, and hence, by these refined subtleties and distinctions,
only add to their blindness; for here are ignorant
rustics, not only dealing with a branch of learning, but that
branch astronomy! It must still, however, be admitted that
the observation of the heavens plays a very important part in
the operations of agriculture; and Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> we find, gives it as
his advice, that before any thing else, we should learn the
theory of the winds, and the revolutions of the stars; for, as he
says, the agriculturist, no less than the mariner, should regulate
his movements thereby. It is an arduous attempt, and
almost beyond all hope of success, to make an endeavour to introduce
the divine science of the heavens to the uninformed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
mind of the rustic; still, however, with a view to such vast
practical results as must be derived from this kind of knowledge,
I shall make the attempt. There are some astronomical
difficulties, however, which have been experienced by the
learned even, that ought to be first submitted for consideration,
in order that the mind may feel some encouragement on abandoning
the study of the heavens, and may be acquainted with
facts at least, even though it is still unable to see into futurity.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_57"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 57. (25.)—ARRANGEMENT OF THE STARS ACCORDING TO THE
TERRESTRIAL DAYS AND NIGHTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the first place, it is almost an utter impossibility to calculate
with a fair degree of accuracy the days of the year and
the movements of the sun. To the three hundred and sixty-five
days there are still to be added the intercalary days, the
result of the additional quarters of a day and night: hence it
is, that it is found impossible to ascertain with exactness the
proper periods for the appearance of the stars. To this we
must add, too, a certain degree of uncertainty connected with
these matters, that is universally admitted; thus, for instance,
bad and wintry weather will often precede, by several days,
the proper period for the advent of that season, a state of things
known to the Greeks as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προχειμάζειν</span>;<a id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> while at another time,
it will last longer than usual, a state of circumstances known as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειμάζειν</span>.<a id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The effects, too, of the changes that take place
in the seasons will sometimes be felt later, and at other times
earlier, upon their reaching the face of the earth; and we not
unfrequently hear the remark made, upon the return of fine
weather, that the action of such and such a constellation is
now completed.<a id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> And then, again, as all these ph&aelig;nomena depend
upon certain stars, arranged and regulated in the vault of
heaven, we find intervening, in accordance with the movements;
of certain stars, hailstorms and showers, themselves productive
of no slight results, as we have already observed,<a id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> and apt to
interfere with the anticipated regular recurrence of the seasons.
Nor are we to suppose that these disappointments fall upon the
human race only, for other animated beings, as well as ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
are deceived in regard to them, although endowed with even a
greater degree of sagacity upon these points than we are, from
the fact of their very existence depending so materially upon
them. Hence it is, that we sometimes see the summer birds
killed by too late or too early cold, and the winter birds by
heat coming out of the usual season. It is for this reason,
that Virgil<a id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> has recommended us to study the courses of the
planets, and has particularly warned us to watch the passage
of the cold star Saturn.</p>

<p>There are some who look upon the appearance of the butterfly
as the surest sign of spring, because of the extreme delicacy
of that insect. In this present year,<a id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> however, in which I
am penning these lines, it has been remarked that the flights
of butterflies have been killed three several times, by as many
returns of the cold; while the foreign birds, which brought
us by the sixth of the calends of February<a id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> every indication
of an early spring, after that had to struggle against a winter
of the greatest severity. In treating of these matters, we have
to meet a twofold difficulty: first of all, we have to ascertain
whether or not the celestial ph&aelig;nomena are regulated by
certain laws, and then we have to seek how to reconcile those
laws with apparent facts. We must, however, be more particularly
careful to take into account the convexity of the earth,
and the differences of situation in the localities upon the face
of the globe; for hence it is, that the same constellation shows
itself to different nations at different times, the result being,
that its influence is by no means perceptible everywhere at the
same moment. This difficulty has been considerably enhanced,
too, by various authors, who, after making their observations
in different localities, and indeed, in some instances, in the same
locality, have yet given us varying or contradictory results.</p>

<p>There have been three great schools of astronomy, the Chald&aelig;an,
the &AElig;gyptian, and the Grecian. To these has been
added a fourth school, which was established by the Dictator
C&aelig;sar among ourselves, and to which was entrusted the duty
of regulating the year in conformity with the sun’s revolution,<a id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
under the auspices of Sosigenes, an astronomer of considerable
learning and skill. His theory, too, upon the discovery of certain
errors, has since been corrected, no intercalations having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
been made for twelve<a id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> successive years, upon its being found
that the year which before had anticipated the constellations,
was now beginning to fall behind them. Even Sosigenes himself,
too, though more correct than his predecessors, has not
hesitated to show, by his continual corrections in the three
several treatises which he composed, that he still entertained
great doubts on the subject. The writers, too, whose names are
inserted at the beginning of this work,<a id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> have sufficiently revealed
the fact of these discrepancies, the opinions of one being
rarely found to agree with those of another. This, however,
is less surprising in the case of those whose plea is the difference
of the localities in which they wrote. But with reference to
those who, though living in the same country, have still arrived
at different results, we shall here mention one remarkable
instance of discrepancy. Hesiod—for under his name, also,
we have a treatise extant on the Science of the Stars<a id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>—has
stated that the morning setting of the Vergili&aelig; takes place at
the moment of the autumnal equinox; whereas Thales, we
find, makes it the twenty-fifth day after the equinox, Anaximander
the twenty-ninth, and Euctemon the forty-eighth.</p>

<p>As for ourselves, we shall follow the calculations made by
Julius C&aelig;sar,<a id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> which bear reference more particularly to Italy;
though at the same time, we shall set forth the dicta of various
other writers, bearing in mind that we are treating not of an
individual country, but of Nature considered in her totality.
In doing this, however, we shall name, not the writers themselves,
for that would be too lengthy a task, but the countries
in reference to which they speak. The reader must bear in
mind, then, that for the sake of saving space, under the head
of Attica, we include the islands of the Cyclades as well; under
that of Macedonia, Magnesia and Thracia; under that of Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Phœnice, Cyprus, and Cilicia; under that of Bœotia, Locris,
Phocis, and the adjoining countries; under that of Hellespont,
Chersonesus, and the contiguous parts as far as Mount Athos;
under that of Ionia, Asia<a id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> and the islands of Asia; under that
of Peloponnesus, Achaia, and the regions lying to the west of
it. Chald&aelig;a, when mentioned, will signify Assyria and Babylonia,
as well.</p>

<p>My silence as to Africa,<a id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> Spain, and the provinces of Gaul,
will occasion no surprise, from the fact that no one has published
any observations made upon the stars in those countries.
Still, however, there will be no difficulty in calculating them,
even for these regions as well, on reference being made to the
parallels which have been set forth in the Sixth Book.<a id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> By
adopting this course, an accurate acquaintance may be made
with the astronomical relations, not only of individual nations,
but of cities even as well. By taking the circular parallels
which we have there appended to the several portions of the
earth respectively, and applying them to the countries in question,
that are similarly situate, it will be found that the rising
of the heavenly bodies will be the same for all parts within
those parallels, where the shadows projected are of equal length.
It is also deserving of remark, that the seasons have their
periodical recurrences, without any marked difference, every
four years, in consequence of the influence<a id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> of the sun, and that
the characteristics of the seasons are developed in excess every
eighth year, at the revolution of every hundredth moon.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_58"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 58.—THE RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The whole of this system is based upon the observation of
three branches of the heavenly ph&aelig;nomena, the rising of the
constellations, their setting, and the regular recurrence of the
seasons. These risings and settings may be observed in two
different ways:—The stars are either concealed, and cease to
be seen at the rising of the sun, or else present themselves to
our view at his setting—this last being more generally known
by the name of “emersion” than of “rising,” while their disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
is rather an “occultation” than a “setting.”—Considered,
again, in another point of view, when upon certain
days they begin to appear or disappear, at the setting
or the rising of the sun, as the case may be, these are called
their morning or their evening settings or risings, according
as each of these ph&aelig;nomena takes place at day-break or twilight.
It requires an interval of three quarters of an hour at least before
the rising of the sun or after his setting, for the stars to
be visible to us. In addition to this, there are certain stars
which rise and set twice.<a id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> All that we here state bears reference,
it must be remembered, to the fixed stars only.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_59"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 59.—THE EPOCHS OF THE SEASONS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The year is divided into four periods or seasons, the recurrence
of which is indicated by the increase or diminution of the
daylight. Immediately after the winter solstice the days begin
to increase, and by the time of the vernal equinox, or in other
words, in ninety days and three hours, the day is equal in
length to the night. After this, for ninety-four days and
twelve hours, the days continue to increase, and the nights to
diminish in proportion, up to the summer solstice; and from
that point the days, though gradually decreasing, are still in
excess of the nights for ninety-two days, twelve hours, until the
autumnal equinox. At this period the days are of equal
length with the nights, and after it they continue to decrease
inversely to the nights until the winter solstice, a period
of eighty-eight days and three hours. In all these calculations,
it must be remembered, equinoctial<a id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> hours are spoken
of, and not those measured arbitrarily in reference to the
length of any one day in particular. All these seasons, too,
commence at the eighth degree of the signs of the Zodiac.
The winter solstice begins at the eighth degree of Capricorn,
the eighth<a id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> day before the calends of January, in general;<a id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> the
vernal equinox at the eighth degree of Aries; the summer
solstice, at the eighth degree of Cancer; and the autumnal
equinox at the eighth degree of Libra: and it is rarely that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
these days do not respectively give some indication of a change
in the weather.</p>

<p>These four seasons again, are subdivided, each of them, into
two equal parts. Thus, for instance, between the summer
solstice and the autumnal equinox, the setting of the Lyre,<a id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>
on the forty-sixth day, indicates the beginning of autumn; between
the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, the morning
setting of the Vergili&aelig;, on the forty-fourth day, denotes
the beginning of winter; between the winter solstice and the
vernal equinox, the prevalence of the west winds on the forty-fifth
day, denotes the commencement of spring; and between
the vernal equinox and the summer solstice, the morning rising
of the Vergili&aelig;, on the forty-eighth day, announces the commencement
of summer. We shall here make seed-time, or in
other words, the morning setting of the Vergili&aelig;, our starting-point;<a id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
and shall not interrupt the thread of our explanation
by making any mention of the minor constellations, as such a
course would only augment the difficulties that already exist.
It is much about this period that the stormy constellation of
Orion departs, after traversing a large portion of the heavens.<a id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_60"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 60.—THE PROPER TIME FOR WINTER SOWING.</span></h3></div>

<p>Most persons anticipate the proper time for sowing, and begin
to put in the corn immediately after the eleventh day of
the autumnal equinox, at the rising of the Crown, when we
may reckon, almost to a certainty, upon several days of rainy
weather in succession. Xenophon<a id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> is of opinion, that sowing
should not be commenced until the Deity has given us the
signal for it, a term by which Cicero understands the rains that
prevail in November. The true method to be adopted, however,
is not to sow until the leaves begin to fall. Some persons
are of opinion that this takes place at the setting of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Vergili&aelig;, or the third day before the ides of November, as
already stated,<a id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> and they carefully observe it, for it is a constellation
very easily remarked in the heavens, and warns us
to resume our winter clothes.<a id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> Hence it is, that immediately
on its setting, the approach of winter is expected, and care is
taken by those who are on their guard against the exorbitant
charges of the shop-keepers, to provide themselves with an
appropriate dress. If the Vergili&aelig; set with cloudy weather,
it forebodes a rainy winter, and the prices of cloaks<a id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> immediately
rise; but if, on the other hand, the weather is clear at
that period, a sharp winter is to be expected, and then the
price of garments of other descriptions is sure to go up. But
as to the husbandman, unacquainted as he is with the ph&aelig;nomena
of the heavens, his brambles are to him in place of
constellations, and if he looks at the ground he sees it covered
with their leaves. This fall of the leaves, earlier in one place
and later in another, is a sure criterion of the temperature of
the weather; for there is a great affinity between the effects
produced by the weather in this respect, and the nature of the
soil and climate. There is this peculiar advantage, too, in the
careful observation of these effects, that they are sure to be
perceptible throughout the whole earth, while at the same time
they have certain features which are peculiar to each individual
locality.—A person may perhaps be surprised at this, who does
not bear in mind that the herb pennyroyal,<a id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> which is hung up
in our larders, always blossoms on the day of the winter solstice;
so firmly resolved is Nature that nothing shall remain
concealed from us, and in that spirit has given us the fall of
the leaf as the signal for sowing.</p>

<p>Such is the true method of interpreting all these ph&aelig;nomena,
granted to us by Nature as a manifestation of her will. It
is in this way that she warns us to prepare the ground, makes
us a promise of a manure, as it were, in the fall of the leaves,
announces to us that the earth and the productions thereof are
thus protected by her against the cold, and warns us to hasten
the operations of agriculture.</p>

POPPY.</span></h3></div>

<p>Varro<a id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> has given no other sign but this<a id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> for our guidance
in sowing the bean. Some persons are of opinion that it should
be sown at full moon, the lentil between the twenty-fifth and
thirtieth day of the moon, and the vetch on the same days of
the moon; and they assure us that if this is done they will be
exempt from the attacks of slugs. Some say, however, that
if wanted for fodder, they may be sown at these periods, but
if for seed, in the spring. There is another sign, more evident
still, supplied us by the marvellous foresight of Nature, with
reference to which we will give the words employed by Cicero<a id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a>
himself:</p>

<p>
“The lentisk, ever green and ever bent<br />
Beneath its fruits, affords a threefold crop:<br />
Thrice teeming, thrice it warns us when to plough.”<br />
</p>

<p>One of the periods here alluded to, is the same that is now
under consideration, being the appropriate time also for sowing
flax and the poppy.<a id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> With reference to this last, Cato gives the
following advice: “Burn, upon land where corn has been grown,
the twigs and branches which are of no use to you, and when
that is done, sow the poppy there.” The wild poppy, which
is of an utility that is quite marvellous, is boiled in honey as a
remedy for diseases in the throat,<a id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> while the cultivated kind is
a powerful narcotic. Thus much in reference to winter sowing.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_62"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 62.—WORK TO BE DONE IN THE COUNTRY IN EACH
MONTH RESPECTIVELY.</span></h3></div>

<p>And now, in order to complete what we may call in some
measure an abridgment of the operations of agriculture, it is as
well to add that it will be a good plan at the same period to
manure the roots of trees, and to mould up the vines—a single
hand being sufficient for one jugerum. Where, too, the nature
of the locality will allow it, the vines, and the trees upon which
they are trained, should be lopped, and the soil turned up with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the mattock for seed plots; trenches, too, should be opened out,
and the water drained from off the fields, and the presses<a id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a>
should be well washed and put away. Never put eggs beneath
the hen between the calends of November<a id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> and the winter
solstice:<a id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> during all the summer and up to the calends of November,
you may put thirteen under the hen; but the number
must be smaller in winter, not less than nine, however.
Democritus is of opinion, that the winter will turn out of the
same character<a id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> as the weather on the day of the winter solstice
and the three succeeding days; the same too with the
summer and the weather at the summer solstice. About the
winter solstice, for about twice seven days mostly, while the
halcyon<a id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> is sitting, the winds are lulled, and the weather
serene;<a id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> but in this case, as in all others, the influence of the
stars must only be judged of by the result, and we must not
expect the changes of the weather, as if out upon their recognizances,<a id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>
to make their appearance exactly on certain predetermined
days.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_63"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 63.—WORK TO BE DONE AT THE WINTER SOLSTICE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Be careful never to touch the vine at the winter solstice.
Hyginus recommends us to strain and even rack-off wine at
the seventh day after the winter solstice, provided the moon is
seven days old. About this period, also, the cherry-tree, he
says, should be planted. Acorns, too, should now be put in
soak for the oxen, a modius for each pair. If given in larger
quantities, this food will prove injurious to their health; and
whenever it is given, if they are fed with it for less than thirty
days in succession, an attack of scab in the spring, it is said,
will be sure to make you repent.</p>

<p>This, too, is the period that we have already assigned<a id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> for
cutting timber—other kinds of work, again, may be found for
the hours of the night, which are then so greatly prolonged.
There are baskets, hurdles, and panniers to be woven, and wood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
to be cut for torches: squared stays<a id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> for the vine may be prepared,
too, thirty in the day time, and if rounded,<a id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> as many as
sixty. In the long hours of the evening, too, some five squared
stays, or ten rounded ones may be got ready, and the same
number while the day is breaking.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_64"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 64.—WORK TO BE DONE BETWEEN THE WINTER SOLSTICE
AND THE PREVALENCE OF THE WEST WINDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Between the winter solstice and the period when the west
winds begin to prevail, the following, according to C&aelig;sar, are the
more important signs afforded by the constellations: the Dog
sets in the morning, upon the third<a id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> day before the calends of
January; a day on the evening of which the Eagle sets to the
people of Attica and the adjoining countries. On the day before<a id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>
the nones of January, according to C&aelig;sar’s computation,
the Dolphin rises in the morning, and on the next day, the
Lyre, upon the evening of which the Arrow sets to the people
of Egypt. Upon the sixth<a id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> day before the ides of January,
the Dolphin sets in the evening, and Italy has many days
of continuous cold; the same is the case also when the sun
enters Aquarius, about the sixteenth<a id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> day before the calends of
February. On the eighth<a id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> before the calends of February, the
star which Tubero calls the Royal Star<a id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> sets in the morning in
the breast of Leo, and in the evening of the day before<a id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> the
nones of February, the Lyre sets.</p>

<p>During the latter days of this period, whenever the nature
of the weather will allow of it, the ground should be turned
up with a double mattock, for planting the rose and the vine—sixty
men to a jugerum. Ditches, too, should be cleaned
out, or new ones made; and the time of day-break may be usefully
employed in sharpening iron tools, fitting on handles, repairing
such dolia<a id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> as may have been broken, and rubbing up
and cleaning their staves.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_65"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 65.—WORK TO BE DONE BETWEEN THE PREVALENCE OF
THE WEST WINDS AND THE VERNAL EQUINOX.</span></h3></div>

<p>Between the prevalence of the west winds and the vernal
equinox, the fourteenth day before<a id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> the calends of March, according
to C&aelig;sar, announces three days of changeable weather;
the same is the case, too, with the eighth<a id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> before the calends
of March, at the first appearance of the swallow, Arcturus
rising on the evening of the next day. C&aelig;sar has observed,
that the same takes place on the third<a id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> before the nones of
March, at the rising of Cancer; and most authorities say the same
with reference to the emersion of the Vintager.<a id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> On the eighth<a id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a>
before the ides of March, the northern limb of Pisces<a id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> rises,
and on the next day Orion, at which period also, in Attica, the
Kite is first seen. C&aelig;sar has noted, too, the setting of Scorpio
on the ides of March,<a id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> a day that was so fatal to him; and on
the fifteenth<a id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> before the calends of April, the Kite appears in
Italy. On the twelfth<a id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> before the calends of April, the Horse
sets in the morning.</p>

<p>This interval of time is a period of extreme activity for the
agriculturist, and affords him a great number of occupations,
in reference to which, however, he is extremely liable to be deceived.
He is summoned to the commencement of these
labours, not upon the day on which the west winds ought to
begin, but upon the day on which they really do begin, to blow.
This moment then must be looked for with the most careful
attention, as it is a signal which the Deity has vouchsafed us
in this month, attended with no doubts or equivocations, if
only looked for with scrupulous care. We have already stated
in the Second Book,<a id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> the quarter in which this wind blows,
and the exact point from which it comes, and before long we
shall have occasion to speak of it again still more in detail.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, setting out from the day, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
it may happen to be, on which the west winds begin to
prevail (for it is not always on the seventh before the ides of
February<a id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> that they do begin), whether, in fact, they begin
to blow before the usual time, as is the case with an early
spring, or whether after, which generally happens when the
winter is prolonged—there are subjects innumerable to engage
the attention of the agriculturist, and those, of course, should
be the first attended to, which will admit of no delay. Three
month wheat must now be sown, the vine pruned in the way
we have already<a id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> described, the olive carefully attended to,
fruit-trees put in and grafted, vineyards cleaned and hoed,
seedlings laid out, and replaced in the nursery by others, the
reed, the willow, and the broom planted and lopped, and the
elm, the poplar, and the plane planted in manner already mentioned.
At this period, also, the crops of corn ought to be
weeded,<a id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> and the winter kinds, spelt more particularly, well
hoed. In doing this, there is a certain rule to be observed, the
proper moment being when four blades have made their appearance,
and with the bean this should never be done until three
leaves have appeared above ground; even then, however, it is a
better plan to clean them only with a slight hoeing, in preference
to digging up the ground—but in no case should they ever be
touched the first fifteen days of their blossom. Barley must
never be hoed except when it is quite dry: take care, too, to
have all the pruning done by the vernal equinox. Four men
will be sufficient for pruning a jugerum of vineyard, and each
hand will be able to train fifteen vines to their trees.<a id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>At this period, too, attention should be paid to the gardens
and rose-beds, subjects which will be separately treated of in
succeeding Books; due care should be given to ornamental
gardening as well. It is now, too, the very best time for
making ditches. The ground should now be opened for future
purposes, as we find recommended by Virgil<a id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> in particular,
in order that the sun may thoroughly warm the clods. It is a
piece of even more sound advice, which recommends us to
plough no lands in the middle of spring but those of middling
quality; for if this is done with a rich soil, weeds will be
sure to spring up in the furrows immediately; and if, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
other hand, it is a thin, meagre land, as soon as the heat comes
on, it will be dried up, and so lose all the moisture which
should be reserved to nourish the seed when sown. It is a much
better plan, beyond a doubt, to plough such soils as these in
autumn.</p>

<p>Cato<a id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> lays down the following rules for the operations of
spring. “Ditches,” he says, “should be dug in the seed-plots,
vines should be grafted, and the elm, the fig, the olive,
and other fruit-trees planted in dense and humid soils. Such
meadows<a id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> as are not irrigated, must be manured in a dry
moon, protected from the western blasts, and carefully cleaned:
noxious weeds must be rooted up, fig-trees cleared, new seed-plots
made, and the old ones dressed: all this should be done
before you begin to hoe the vineyard. When the pear is in
blossom, too, you should begin to plough, where it is a meagre
gravelly soil. When you have done all this, you may plough
the more heavy, watery soils, doing this the last of all.”</p>

<p>The proper time for ploughing, then,<a id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> is denoted by these
two signs, the earliest fruit of the lentisk<a id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> making its appearance,
and the blossoming of the pear. There is a third sign
however, as well, the flowering of the squill among the bulbous,<a id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a>
and of the narcissus among the garland, plants. For
both the squill and the narcissus, as well as the lentisk, flower
three times, denoting by their first flowering the first period
for ploughing, by the second flowering the second, and by the
third flowering the last; in this way it is that one thing affords
hints for another. There is one precaution, too, that is by no
means the least important among them all, not to let ivy touch
the bean while in blossom; for at this period the ivy is noxious<a id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a>
to it, and most baneful in its effects. Some plants, again
afford certain signs which bear reference more particularly to
themselves, the fig for instance; when a few leaves only are
found shooting from the summit, like a cup in shape, then it is
more particularly that the fig-tree should be planted.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_66"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 66.—WORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX.</span></h3></div>

<p>The vernal equinox appears to end on the eighth<a id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> day before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the calends of April. Between the equinox and the
morning rising of the Vergili&aelig;, the calends<a id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> of April announce,
according to C&aelig;sar, [stormy weather].<a id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Upon the third<a id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
before the nones of April, the Vergili&aelig; set in the evening
in Attica, and the day after in Bœotia, but according to C&aelig;sar
and the Chald&aelig;ans, upon the nones.<a id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> In Egypt, at this time,
Orion and his Sword begin to set. According to C&aelig;sar, the
setting of Libra on the sixth before<a id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> the ides of April announces
rain. On the fourteenth before<a id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> the calends of May,
the Sucul&aelig; set to the people of Egypt in the evening, a stormy
constellation, and significant of tempests both by land and sea.
This constellation sets on the sixteenth<a id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> in Attica, and on the
fifteenth, according to C&aelig;sar, announcing four days of bad
weather in succession: in Assyria it sets upon the twelfth<a id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a>
before the calends of May. This constellation has ordinarily the
name of Parilicium, from the circumstance that the eleventh<a id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a>
before the calends of May is observed as the natal day of the
City of Rome; upon this day, too, fine weather generally returns,
and gives us a clear sky for our observations. The
Greeks call the Sucul&aelig; by the name of “Hyades,”<a id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> in consequence
of the rain and clouds which they bring with them;
while our people, misled by the resemblance of the Greek name
to another word<a id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> of theirs, meaning a “pig,” have imagined
that the constellation receives its name from that word, and
have consequently given it, in their ignorance, the name of
“Sucul&aelig;,” or the “Little Pigs.”</p>

<p>In the calculations made by C&aelig;sar, the eighth<a id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> before the
calends of May is a day remarked, and on the seventh<a id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> before
the calends, the constellation of the Kids rises in Egypt. On
the sixth before<a id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> the calends, the Dog sets in the evening in
Bœotia and Attica, and the Lyre rises in the morning. On
the fifth<a id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> before the calends of May, Orion has wholly set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to the people of Assyria, and on the fourth<a id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> before the calends
the Dog. On the sixth before<a id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> the nones of May, the Sucul&aelig;
rise in the morning, according to the calculation of C&aelig;sar, and
on the eighth before<a id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> the ides, the She-goat, which announces
rain. In Egypt the Dog sets in the evening of the same day.
Such are pretty nearly the movements of the constellations up
to the sixth before<a id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> the ides of May, the period of the rising
of the Vergili&aelig;.</p>

<p>In this interval of time, during the first fifteen days, the
agriculturist must make haste and do all the work for which
he has not been able to find time before the vernal equinox;
and he should bear in mind that those who are late in pruning
their vines are exposed to jibes and taunts, in imitation of the
note of the bird of passage known to us as the cuckoo.<a id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> For it
is looked upon as a disgrace, and one that subjects him to well-merited
censure, for that bird, upon its arrival, to find him
only then pruning his vines. Hence it is, too, that we find
those cutting jokes,<a id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> of which our peasantry are the object, at
the beginning of spring. Still, however, all such jokes are to
be looked upon as most abominable, from the ill omens<a id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> they
convey.</p>

<p>In this way, then, we see that, in agricultural operations,
the most trifling things are construed as so many hints supplied
us by Nature. The latter part of this period is the proper
time for sowing panic and millet; the precise moment, however,
is just after the barley has ripened. In the case of the
very same land, too, there is one sign that points in common
both to the ripening of the barley and the sowing of panic and
millet—the appearance of the glow-worm, shining in the fields
at night. “Cicindel&aelig;”<a id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> is the name given by the country
people to these flying stars, while the Greeks call them “lampyrides,”—another
manifestation of the incredible bounteousness
of Nature.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_67"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 67. (27.)—WORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE RISING OF THE
VERGILI&AElig;: HAY-MAKING.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nature had already formed the Vergili&aelig;, a noble group of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
stars, in the heavens; but not content with these, she has
made others as well for the face of the earth, crying aloud, as
it were:<a id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> “Why contemplate the heavens, husbandman?
Why, rustic, look up at the stars? Do not the nights already
afford you a sleep too brief for your fatigues? Behold now! I
scatter stars amid the grass for your service, and I reveal them
to you in the evening, as you return from your work; and
that you may not disregard them, I call your attention to this
marvel. Do you not see how the wings of this insect cover
a body bright and shining like fire, and how that body gives
out light in the hours of the night even? I have given you
plants to point out to you the hours, and, that you may not
have to turn your eyes from the earth, even to view the sun,
the heliotropium and the lupine have been made by me to move
with his movements. Why then still look upwards, and scan
the face of heaven? Behold, here before your very feet are
your Vergili&aelig;; upon a certain day do they make their appearance,
and for a certain time do they stay. Equally certain,
too, it is that of that constellation they are the offspring.
Whoever, then, shall put in his summer seeds before they have
made their appearance, will infallibly find himself in the
wrong.”</p>

<p>It is in this interval, too, that the little bee comes forth, and
announces that the bean is about to blossom; for it is the bean
in flower that summons it forth. We will here give another
sign, which tells us when the cold is gone; as soon as ever
you see the mulberry<a id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> in bud, you have no occasion to fear any
injury from the rigour of the weather.</p>

<p>It is the time, now, to put in cuttings of the olive, to clear
away between the olive-trees, and, in the earlier days of the
equinox, to irrigate the meadows. As soon, however, as the
grass puts forth a stem, you must shut off the water from the
fields.<a id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> You must now lop the leafy branches of the vine, it
being the rule that this should be done as soon as the branches
have attained four fingers in length; one labourer will be sufficient
for a jugerum. The crops of corn, too, should be hoed
over again, an operation which lasts twenty days. It is generally
thought, however, that it is injurious to both vine and
corn to begin hoeing directly after the equinox. This is the
proper time, too, for washing sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>After the rising of the Vergili&aelig; the more remarkable signs
are, according to C&aelig;sar, the morning rising of Arcturus, which
takes place on the following day;<a id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> and the rising of the Lyre
on the third<a id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> before the ides of May. The She-goat sets in
the evening of the twelfth before<a id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> the calends of June, and
in Attica the Dog. On the eleventh<a id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> before the calends of
June, according to C&aelig;sar, Orion’s Sword begins to appear; and,
according to the same writer, on the fourth<a id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> before the nones
of June the Eagle rises in the evening, and in Assyria as well.
On the seventh<a id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> before the ides of June Arcturus sets in the
morning to the people of Italy, and on the fourth<a id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> before the
ides the Dolphin rises in the evening. On the seventeenth<a id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>
before the calends of July Orion’s Sword rises in Italy, and,
four days later, in Egypt. On the eleventh<a id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> before the calends
of July, according to C&aelig;sar’s reckoning, Orion’s Sword begins
to set; and the eighth<a id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> before the calends of July, the longest
day in the year, with the shortest night, brings us to the summer
solstice.</p>

<p>In this interval of time the vine should be cleared of its
superfluous branches, and care taken to give an old vine one
turning up at the roots, a young tree two. Sheep, too, are
sheared at this period, lupines turned up for manuring the
land, the ground dug, vetches cut for fodder, and beans gathered
in and threshed.</p>

<p>(28.) About the calends of June<a id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> the meadows are mown;
the cultivation of which, the one which is the easiest of all,
and requires the smallest outlay, leads me to enter into some
further details relative to it. Meadow lands should be selected
in a rich, or else a moist or well-watered, soil, and care should
be taken to drain the rain-water upon them from the high-road.
The best method of ensuring a good crop of grass, is
first to plough the land, and then to harrow it: but, before
passing the harrow over it, the ground should be sprinkled
with such seed as may have fallen from the hay in the hay-lofts
and mangers. The land should not be watered, however,
the first year,<a id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> nor should cattle be put to graze upon it before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the second hay-harvest, for fear lest the blade should be torn
up by the roots, or be trodden down and stunted in its growth.
Meadow land will grow old in time, and it requires to be renovated
every now and then, by sowing upon it a crop of beans,
or else rape or millet, after which it should be sown the next
year with corn, and then left for hay the third. Care, too,
should be taken, every time the grass is cut, to pass the sickle
over the ground, and so cut the aftermath which the mowers
have left behind; for it is a very bad plan to leave any of the
grass and let it shed its seed there. The best crop for meadow
land is trefoil,<a id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> and the next best is grass;<a id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> nummulus<a id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> is
the very worst of all, as it bears a pod which is particularly
injurious; equis&aelig;tis,<a id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> too, which derives its name from its
resemblance to horse-hair, is of a noxious character. The proper
time for mowing grass is when the ear begins to shed its
blossom and to grow strong: care must be taken to cut it
before it becomes dry and parched. “Don’t mow your hay
too late,” says Cato;<a id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> “but cut it before the seed is ripe.”
Some persons turn the water upon it the day before mowing,
where it is practicable to do so. It is the best plan to cut hay
in the night while the dews are falling.<a id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> In some parts of
Italy the mowing is not done till after harvest.</p>

<p>This operation, too, was a very expensive one in ancient
times. In those days the only whetstones<a id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> known were
those of Crete and other places beyond sea, and they only used
oil to sharpen the scythe with. For this purpose the mower
moved along, with a horn, to hold the oil, fastened to his
thigh. Italy has since furnished us with whetstones which are
used with water, and give an edge to the iron quite equal to
that imparted by the file; these water-whetstones, however,
turn green very quickly. Of the scythe<a id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> there are two varieties;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the Italian,<a id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> which is considerably shorter than the
other, and can be handled among underwood even; and the
Gallic, which makes quicker work<a id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> of it, when employed on
extensive domains, for there they cut the grass in the middle
only, and pass over the shorter blades. The Italian mowers
cut with one hand only. It is a fair day’s work for one man
to cut a jugerum of grass, and for another to bind twelve hundred
sheaves of four pounds each. When the grass is cut it
should be turned towards the sun, and must never be stacked
until it is quite dry. If this last precaution is not carefully
taken, a kind of vapour will be seen arising from the rick in
the morning, and as soon as the sun is up it will ignite to a
certainty, and so be consumed. When the grass has been cut,
the meadow must be irrigated again, for the purpose of ensuring
a crop in the autumn, known to us as the “cordum,” or
aftermath. At Interamna in Umbria the grass is cut four
times<a id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> a-year, and this although the meadows there are not
irrigated,—in most places, three. After all this has been done,
too, the pasturage of the land is found no less lucrative than
the hay it has produced. This, however, is a matter of consideration
for those more particularly who rear large herds of
cattle, and every one whose occupation it is to breed beasts of
burden, will have his own opinions upon the subject: it is
found, however, the most lucrative of all by those whose business
it is to train chariot-horses.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_68"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 68.—THE SUMMER SOLSTICE.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> that the summer solstice arrives at
the eighth degree of Cancer, and upon the eighth day before<a id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>
the calends of July: this is an important crisis in the year,
and of great interest to the whole earth. Up to this period
from the time of the winter solstice the days have gone on
increasing, and the sun has continued for six months making
his ascension towards the north; having now surmounted the
heights of the heavens, at this point he reaches the goal, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
after doing so, commences his return towards the south; the
consequence of which is, that for the next six months he
increases the nights and subtracts from the length of the days.
From this period, then, it is the proper time to gather in and
store away the various crops in succession, and so make all
due preparations for the rigour and severity of the winter.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that Nature should point out to
us the moment of this change by certain signs of an indubitable
character; and she has accordingly placed them beneath
the very hands of the agriculturist, bidding the leaves turn
round<a id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> upon that day, and so denote that the luminary has now
run its course. And it is not the leaves of trees only that are
wild and far remote that do this, nor have those persons who
are on the look-out for these signs to go into devious forests
and mountain tracts to seek them. Nor yet, on the other
hand, are they to be seen in the leaves of trees only that are
grown in the vicinity of cities or reared by the hand of the
ornamental gardener, although in them they are to be seen
as well. Nature upon this occasion turns the leaf of the
olive which meets us at every step; she turns the leaf of
the linden, sought by us, as it is, for a thousand purposes;
she turns the leaf of the white poplar, too, wedded to the vine
that grows upon its trunk. And still, for her, all this is not
enough. “You have the elm,” she says, “reared for the support
of the vine, and the leaf of that I will make to turn as
well. The leaves of this tree you have to gather for fodder, the
leaves of the vine you prune away. Only look upon them,
and there you behold the solstice;<a id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> they are now pointing
towards a quarter of the heavens the reverse of that towards
which they looked the day before. The twigs of the withy,
that most lowly of trees, you employ for tying things without
number. You are a head taller than it—I will make its
leaves to turn round as well. Why complain, then, that you
are but a rustic peasant? It shall be no fault of mine if
you do not understand the heavens and become acquainted
with the movements of the celestial bodies. I will give
another sign, too, that shall address itself to your ear—only
listen for the cooing of the ring-doves; and beware of supposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
that the summer solstice is past, until you see the
wood-pigeon sitting on her eggs.”</p>

<p>Between the summer solstice and the setting of the Lyre, on
the sixth day before the calends of July,<a id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> according to C&aelig;sar’s
reckoning, Orion rises, and upon the fourth<a id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> before the nones
of July, his Belt rises to the people of Assyria. Upon the
morning of the same day, also, the scorching constellation of
Procyon rises. This last constellation has no name with the
Romans, unless, indeed, we would consider it as identical with
Canicula,<a id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> or Lesser Dog, which we find depicted among
the stars; this last is productive of excessive heat, as we shall
shortly have further occasion to state. On the fourth<a id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> before
the nones of July, the Crown sets in the morning to the people
of Chald&aelig;a, and in Attica, the whole of Orion has risen by
that day. On the day before<a id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> the ides of July, the rising of
Orion ends to the Egyptians also; on the sixteenth<a id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> before
the calends of August, Procyon rises to the people of Assyria,
and, the day but one after, of nearly all other countries as well,
indicating a crisis that is universally known among all nations,
and which by us is called the rising of the Dog-star; the sun
at this period entering the first degree of Leo. The Dog-star
rises on the twenty-third day after the summer solstice; the
influence of it is felt by both ocean, and earth, and even by many
of the animals as well, as stated by us elsewhere on the appropriate
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> No less veneration, in fact, is paid to this
star, than to those that are consecrated to certain gods; it
kindles the flames of the sun, and is one great source of the
heats of summer.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth<a id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> day before the calends of August, the
Eagle sets in the morning to the people of Egypt, and the
breezes that are the precursors of the Etesian winds, begin to
blow; these, according to C&aelig;sar, are first perceived in Italy,
on the tenth before<a id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> the calends of August. The Eagle sets
in the morning of that day to the people of Attica, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
third before<a id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> the calends of August, the Royal Star in the
breast of Leo rises in the morning, according to C&aelig;sar. On
the eighth before<a id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> the ides of August, one half of Arcturus
has ceased to be visible, and on the third before<a id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> the ides the
Lyre, by its setting, opens the autumn,—according to C&aelig;sar at
least; though a more exact calculation has since shown, that
this takes place on the sixth day before<a id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> the ides of that month.</p>

<p>The time that intervenes between these periods is one that
is of primary importance in the cultivation of the vine; as
the constellation of which we have spoken, under the name of
Canicula, has now to decide upon the fate of the grape. It is
at this period that the grapes are said to be charred,<a id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> a blight
falling upon them which burns them away, as though red-hot
coals had been applied to them. There is no hail that can be
compared with this destructive malady, nor yet any of those
tempests, which have been productive of such scarcity and
dearth. For the evil effects of these, at the very utmost, are
only felt in isolated districts, while the coal blight,<a id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> on the other
hand, extends over whole countries, far and wide. Still, however,
the remedy would not be very difficult, were it not that
men would much rather calumniate Nature, than help themselves.
It is said that Democritus,<a id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> who was the first to comprehend
and demonstrate that close affinity which exists between
the heavens and the earth, finding his laborious researches
upon that subject slighted by the more opulent of his
fellow-citizens, and presaging the high price of oil, which was
about to result upon the rising of the Vergili&aelig;, (as we have
already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> and shall have to explain more fully hereafter),
bought up all the oil in the country, which was then at
a very low figure, from the universal expectation of a fine crop
of olives; a proceeding which greatly surprised all who knew
that a life of poverty and learned repose was so entirely the
object of his aspirations. When, however, his motives had
been fully justified by the result, and vast riches had flowed in
upon him apace, he returned all his profits to the disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
proprietors, whose avarice had now taught them to repent,
thinking it quite sufficient to have thus proved how easy it
was for him to acquire riches whenever he pleased. At a
more recent period, again, Sextius,<a id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> a Roman philosopher residing
at Athens, made a similar application of his knowledge.
Such, then, is the utility of science, the instruction provided
by which it shall be my aim, as clearly and as perspicuously
as possible, to apply to the various occupations of a country
life.</p>

<p>Most writers have said that it is the dew, scorched by a
burning sun, that is the cause of mildew<a id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> in corn, and of coal blight
in the vine; this, however, seems to me in a great
measure incorrect, and it is my opinion that all blights result
entirely from cold, and that the sun is productive of no injurious
effects whatever. This, in fact, will be quite evident, if only a
little attention is paid to the subject; for we find that the blight
makes its appearance at first in the night time only, and before
the sun has shone with any vigour. The natural inference is,
that it depends entirely upon the moon, and more particularly
as such a calamity as this is never known to happen except at the
moon’s conjunction, or else at the full moon, periods at which
the influence of that heavenly body is at its greatest height.
For at both of these periods, as already<a id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> stated by us more
than once, the moon is in reality at the full; though during
her conjunction she throws back to the heavens all the light
which she has received from the sun. The difference in the
effects produced by the moon at these two periods is very great,
though at the same time equally apparent; for at the conjunction,
that body is extremely hot in summer, but cold in winter;
while, on the other hand, at the full moon, the nights are
cold in summer, but warm in winter. The reason of this,
although Fabianus and the Greek writers adopt another method
of explaining it, is quite evident. During the moon’s
conjunction in summer, she must of necessity move along with
the sun in an orbit nearer to the earth, and so become warmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
by the heat which she receives by reason of her closer vicinity
to the sun. In winter, again, at the time of the conjunction,
she is farther off from us, the sun being also removed to a
greater distance. On the other hand, again, when the moon
is at the full in summer, she is more remote from the earth,
and in opposition with the sun; while, in winter, she approaches
nearer to us at that period, by adopting the same
orbit as at her conjunction in summer. Naturally humid herself,
as often as from her position she is cold, she congeals to
an unlimited extent the dews which fall at that period of the
year.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_69"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 69.—CAUSES OF STERILITY.</span></h3></div>

<p>But we ought always to bear in mind, more particularly,
that there are two varieties of evils that are inflicted upon the
earth by the heavens. The first of these, known by us under
the name of “tempests,” comprehends hail-storms, hurricanes
and other calamities of a similar nature; when these take place
at the full moon, they come upon us with additional intensity.
These tempests take their rise in certain noxious constellations,
as already stated by us on several occasions, Arcturus, for instance,
Orion, and the Kids.</p>

<p>The other evils that are thus inflicted upon us, supervene with
a bright, clear sky, and amid the silence of the night, no one
being sensible of them until we have perceived their effects.
These dispensations are universal and of a totally different
character from those previously mentioned, and have various
names given to them, sometimes mildew, sometimes blast, and
sometimes coal blight; but in all cases sterility is the infallible
result. It is of these last that we have now to speak, entering
into details which have not hitherto been treated of by any
writer; and first of all we will explain the causes of them.</p>

<p>(29.) Independently of the moon, there are two principal
causes of these calamities, which emanate more particularly
from two quarters of the heavens of but limited extent. On
the one hand, the Vergili&aelig; exercise an especial influence on our
harvests, as it is with their rising that the summer begins, and
with their setting, the winter; thus embracing, in the space of
six months, the harvest, the vintage, and the ripening of all the
vegetable productions. In addition to this, there is a circular
tract in the heavens, quite visible to the human eye even, known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
as the Milky Way. It is the emanations from this, flowing as
it were from the breast, that supply their milky<a id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> nutriment to
all branches of the vegetable world. Two constellations more
particularly mark this circular tract, the Eagle in the north,
and Canicula in the south; of this last, we have already made
mention<a id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> in its appropriate place. This circle traverses also
Sagittarius and Gemini, and passing through the centre of the
sun, cuts the equinoctial line below, the constellation of the
Eagle making its appearance at the point of intersection on
the one side, and Canicula on the other. Hence it is that the
influences of both these constellations develope themselves
upon all cultivated lands; it being at these points only that the
centre of the sun is brought to correspond with that of the
earth. If, then, at the moments of the rising and the setting
of these constellations, the air, soft and pure, transmits these
genial and milky emanations to the earth, the crops will thrive
and ripen apace; but if, on the other hand, the moon, as already<a id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>
mentioned, sheds her chilling dews, the bitterness thereof
infuses itself into these milky secretions, and so kills the
vegetation in its birth. The measure of the injury so inflicted
on the earth depends, in each climate, upon the combination of
the one or other of these causes; and hence it is that it is not
felt in equal intensity throughout the whole earth, nor even precisely
at the same moment of time. We have already<a id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> said
that the Eagle rises in Italy on the thirteenth day<a id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> before the
calends of January, and the ordinary course of Nature does
not permit us before that period to reckon with any degree of
certainty upon the fruits of the earth; for if the moon should
happen to be in conjunction at that time, it will be a necessary
consequence, that all the winter fruits, as well as the early
ones, will receive injury more or less.</p>

<p>The life led by the ancients was rude and illiterate; still,
as will be readily seen, the observations they made were not
less remarkable for ingenuity than are the theories of the present
day. With them there were three set periods for gathering
in the produce of the earth, and it was in honour of these
periods that they instituted the festive days, known as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Robigalia,<a id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> the Floralia, and the Vinalia. The Robigalia were
established by Numa in the fortieth year of his reign, and are
still celebrated on the seventh day before the calends of May,
as it is at this period that mildew<a id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> mostly makes its first attacks
upon the growing corn. Varro fixes this crisis at the
moment at which the sun enters the tenth degree of Taurus,
in accordance with the notions that prevailed in his day: but
the real cause is the fact, that thirty-one<a id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> days after the vernal
equinox, according to the observations of various nations, the
Dog-star sets between the seventh and fourth before the calends
of May, a constellation baneful in itself, and to appease
which a young dog should first be sacrificed.<a id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> The same people
also, in the year of the City 513, instituted the Floralia, a
festival held upon the fourth before<a id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> the calends of May, in
accordance with the oracular injunctions of the Sibyl, to secure
a favourable season for the blossoms and flowers. Varro fixes
this day as the time at which the sun enters the fourteenth
degree of Taurus. If there should happen to be a full moon
during the four days at this period, injury to the corn and all
the plants that are in blossom, will be the necessary result.
The First Vinalia, which in ancient times were established on
the ninth before<a id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> the calends of May, for the purpose of tasting<a id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a>
the wines, have no signification whatever in reference to
the fruits of the earth, any more than the festivals already
mentioned have in reference to the vine and the olive; the
germination of these last not commencing, in fact, till the
rising of the Vergili&aelig;, on the Sixth day before<a id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> the ides of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
May, as already mentioned on previous occasions.<a id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> This, again,
is another period of four days, which should never be blemished
by dews, as the chilling constellation of Arcturus, which sets
on the following day, will be sure to nip the vegetation; still
less ought there to be a full moon at this period.</p>

<p>On the fourth before<a id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> the nones of June, the Eagle rises
again in the evening, a critical day for the olives and vines in
blossom, if there should happen to be a full moon. For my
part, I am of opinion that the eighth<a id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> before the calends of
July, the day of the summer solstice, must be a critical day, for
a similar reason; and that the rising of the Dog-star, twenty-three
days after the summer solstice, must be so too, in case
the moon is then in conjunction; for the excessive heat is productive
of injurious effects, and the grape becomes prematurely
ripened, shrivelled, and tough. Again, if there is a full moon
on the fourth before<a id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> the nones of July, when Canicula rises
to the people of Egypt, or at least on the sixteenth before<a id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a>
the calends of August, when it rises in Italy, it is productive
of injurious results. The same is the case, too, from
the thirteenth day before<a id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> the calends of August, when the
Eagle sets, to the tenth before<a id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> the calends of that month.
The Second Vinalia, which are celebrated on the fourteenth<a id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a>
before the calends of September, bear no reference to these influences.
Varro fixes them at the period at which the Lyre
begins its morning setting, and says that this indicates the beginning
of autumn, the day having been set apart for the purpose
of propitiating the weather: at the present day, however,
it is observed that the Lyre sets on the sixth before<a id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> the ides
of August.</p>

<p>Within these periods there are exerted the sterilizing influences
of the heavens, though I am far from denying that
they may be considerably modified by the nature of the locality,
according as it is cold or hot. Still, however, it is sufficient for
me to have demonstrated the theory; the modifications of its results
depending, in a great degree, upon attentive observation.
It is beyond all question too, that either one of these two causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
will be always productive of its own peculiar effects, the full
moon, I mean, or else the moon’s conjunction. And here it
suggests itself how greatly we ought to admire the bounteous
provisions made for us by Nature; for, in the first place, these
calamitous results cannot by any possibility befall us every year,
in consequence of the fixed revolutions of the stars; nor indeed,
when they do happen, beyond a few nights in the year, and it
may be easily known beforehand which nights those are likely
to be. In order, too, that we might not have to apprehend these
injuries to vegetation in all the months, Nature has so ordained
that the times of the moon’s conjunction in summer, and of the
full moon in winter, with the exception of two days only at
those respective periods, are well ascertained, and that there is
no danger to be apprehended on any but the nights of summer,
and those nights the shortest of all; in the day-time, on the
other hand, there is nothing to fear. And then, besides, these
ph&aelig;nomena may be so easily understood, that the ant even,
that most diminutive of insects, takes its rest during the moon’s
conjunction, but toils on, and that during the night as well, when
the moon is at the full; the bird, too, called the “parra”<a id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a>
disappears upon the day on which Sirius rises, and never reappears
until that star has set; while the witwall,<a id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> on the
other hand, makes its appearance on the day of the summer
solstice. The moon, however, is productive of no noxious
effects at either of these periods, except when the nights are
clear, and every movement of the air is lulled; for so long as
clouds prevail, or the wind is blowing, the night dews never
fall. And then, besides, there are certain remedies to counteract
these noxious influences.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_70"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 70.—REMEDIES AGAINST THESE NOXIOUS INFLUENCES.</span></h3></div>

<p>When you have reason to fear these influences, make bonfires
in the fields and vineyards of cuttings or heaps of chaff, or
else of the weeds that have been rooted up; the smoke<a id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> will
act as a good preservative. The smoke, too, of burning chaff
will be an effectual protection against the effects of fogs, when
likely to be injurious. Some persons recommend that three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
crabs should be burnt<a id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> alive among the trees on which the
vines are trained, to prevent these from being attacked by coal
blight; while others say that the flesh of the silurus<a id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> should
be burnt in a slow fire, in such a way that the smoke may be
dispersed by the wind throughout the vineyard.</p>

<p>Varro informs us, that if at the setting of the Lyre, which
is the beginning of autumn, a painted grape<a id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> is consecrated in
the midst of the vineyard, the bad weather will not be productive
of such disastrous results as it otherwise would. Archibius<a id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a>
has stated, in a letter to Antiochus, king of Syria, that
if a bramble-frog<a id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> is buried in a new earthen vessel, in the
middle of a corn-field, there will be no storms to cause injury.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_71"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 71.—WORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE SUMMER SOLSTICE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The following are the rural occupations for this interval
of time—the ground must have another turning up, and the
trees must be cleared about the roots and moulded up, where
the heat of the locality requires it. Those plants, however,
which are in bud must not be spaded at the roots, except where
the soil is particularly rich. The seed-plots, too, must be well
cleared with the hoe, the barley-harvest got in, and the
threshing-floor prepared for the harvest with chalk, as Cato<a id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a>
tells us, slackened with amurca of olives; Virgil<a id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> makes mention
of a method still more laborious even. In general, however,
it is considered sufficient to make it perfectly level, and
then to cover it with a solution of cow-dung<a id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> and water; this
being thought sufficient to prevent the dust from rising.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_72"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 72. (30.)—THE HARVEST.</span></h3></div>

<p>The mode of getting in the harvest varies considerably. In
the vast domains of the provinces of Gaul a large hollow
frame,<a id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> armed with teeth and supported on two wheels, is
driven through the standing corn, the beasts being yoked<a id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a>
behind it; the result being, that the ears are torn off and
fall within the frame. In other countries the stalks are cut
with the sickle in the middle, and the ears are separated by
the aid of paddle-forks.<a id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> In some places, again, the corn is
torn up by the roots; and it is asserted by those who adopt
this plan, that it is as good as a light turning up for the ground,
whereas, in reality, they deprive it of its juices.<a id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> There are
differences in other respects also: in places where they thatch
their houses with straw, they keep the longest haulms for that
purpose; and where hay is scarce, they employ the straw for
litter. The straw of panic is never used for thatching, and
that of millet is mostly burnt; barley-straw, however, is
always preserved, as being the most agreeable of all as a food
for oxen. In the Gallic provinces panic and millet are gathered,
ear by ear, with the aid of a comb carried in the hand.</p>

<p>In some places the corn is beaten out by machines<a id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> upon
the threshing-floor, in others by the feet of mares, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
others with flails. The later wheat is cut, the more prolific<a id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a>
it is; but if it is got in early, the grain is finer and stronger.
The best rule is to cut it before the grain hardens, and just
as it is changing colour:<a id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> though the oracles on husbandry
say that it is better to begin the harvest two days too soon
than two days too late. Winter and other wheat must be
treated exactly the same way both on the threshing-floor and
in the granary. Spelt, as it is difficult to be threshed, should
be stored with the chaff on, being only disengaged of the straw
and the beard.</p>

<p>Many countries make use of chaff<a id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> for hay; the smoother
and thinner it is, and the more nearly resembling dust, the
better; hence it is that the chaff<a id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> of millet is considered the
best, that of barley being the next best, and that of wheat the
worst of all, except for beasts that are hard worked. In stony
places they break the haulms, when dry, with staves, for the
cattle to lie upon: if there is a deficiency of chaff, the straw
as well is ground for food. The following is the method employed
in preparing it: it is cut early and sprinkled with bay
salt,<a id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> after which it is dried and rolled up in trusses, and given
to the oxen as wanted, instead of hay. Some persons set fire
to the stubble in the fields, a plan that has been greatly extolled
by Virgil:<a id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> the chief merit of it is that the seed of the
weeds is effectually destroyed. The diversity of the methods
employed in harvesting mainly depends upon the extent of the
crops and the price of labour.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_73"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 73.—THE METHODS OF STORING CORN.</span></h3></div>

<p>Connected with this branch of our subject is the method of
storing corn. Some persons recommend that granaries should
be built for the purpose at considerable expense, the walls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
being made of brick, and not less than three<a id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> feet thick; the
corn, they say, should be let in from above, the air being
carefully excluded, and no windows allowed. Others, again,
say that the granary should have an aspect in no direction but
the north-east or north, and that the walls should be built
without lime, that substance being extremely injurious<a id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> to
corn; as to what we find recommended in reference to amurca
of olives, we have already mentioned it on a former<a id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> occasion.
In some places they build their granaries of wood, and upon
pillars,<a id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> thinking it the best plan to leave access for the air on
every side, and from below even. Some persons think, however,
that the grain diminishes in bulk if laid on a floor above
the level of the ground, and that it is liable to ferment beneath
a roof of tiles. Many persons say, too, that the grain should
never be stirred up to air<a id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> it, as the weevil is never known to
penetrate beyond four fingers in depth; consequently, beyond
that depth there is no danger. According to Columella,<a id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> the
west wind is beneficial to grain, a thing that surprises me, as
that wind is generally a very parching<a id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> one. Some persons
recommend that, before housing the corn, a bramble-frog
should be hung up by one of the hind legs at the threshold of
the granary. To me it appears that the most important precaution
of all is to house the grain at the proper time; for if
it is unripe when cut, and not sufficiently firm, or if it is got
in in a heated state, it follows of necessity that noxious insects
will breed in it.</p>

<p>There are several causes which contribute to the preservation
of grain; the outer<a id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> coats in some kinds are more numerous,
as in millet, for instance; the juices are of an oleaginous
nature,<a id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> and so supply ample moisture, as in sesame,
for example; while in other kinds, again, they are naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
bitter,<a id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> as in the lupine and the chicheling vetch. It is in
wheat more particularly that insects breed, as it is apt to heat
from the density of its juices, and the grain is covered with a
thick bran. In barley the chaff is thinner, and the same is the
case with all the leguminous seeds: it is for this reason that they
do not ordinarily breed insects. The bean, however, is covered
with a coat of a thicker substance; and hence it is that it ferments.
Some persons sprinkle wheat, in order to make it
keep the longer, with amurca<a id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> of olives, a quadrantal to a
thousand modii: others, again, with powdered Chalcidian or
Carian chalk, or with worm-wood.<a id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> There is a certain earth
found at Olynthus, and at Cerinthus, in Eubœa, which prevents
grain from spoiling. If garnered in the ear, grain is
hardly ever found to suffer any injury.</p>

<p>The best plan, however, of preserving grain, is to lay it up
in trenches, called “siri,” as they do in Cappadocia, Thracia,
Spain, and at * * * in Africa. Particular care is taken to
dig these trenches in a dry soil, and a layer of chaff is then
placed at the bottom; the grain, too, is always stored in the
ear. In this case, if no air is allowed to penetrate to the corn,
we may rest assured that no noxious insects will ever breed
in it. Varro<a id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> says, that wheat, if thus stored, will keep as
long as fifty years, and millet a hundred; and he assures us
that beans and other leguminous grain, if put away in oil jars
with a covering of ashes, will keep for a great length of time.
He makes a statement, also, to the effect that some beans were
preserved in a cavern in Ambracia from the time of King
Pyrrhus until the Piratical War of Pompeius Magnus, a period
of about two hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>The chick-pea is the only grain in which no insect will
breed while in the granary. Some persons place upon the
heaps of the leguminous grains pitchers full of vinegar and
coated with pitch, a stratum of ashes being laid beneath; and
they fancy that if this is done, no injury will happen. Some,
again, store them in vessels which have held salted provisions,
with a coating of plaster on the top, while other persons are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
in the habit of sprinkling lentils with vinegar scented with
laser,<a id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> and, when dry, giving them a covering of oil. But
the most effectual method of all is to get in everything
that you would preserve from injury at the time of the
moon’s conjunction; and hence it is of the greatest importance
to know, when getting in the harvest, whether it is
for garnering or whether for immediate sale. If cut during the
increase of the moon, grain will increase in size.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_74"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 74. (31.)—THE VINTAGE, AND THE WORKS OF AUTUMN.</span></h3></div>

<p>In accordance with the ordinary divisions of the year, we
now come to autumn, a period which extends from the setting
of the Lyre to the autumnal equinox, and from that to the
setting of the Vergili&aelig; and the beginning of winter. In these
intervals, the more important periods are marked by the rising
of the Horse to the people of Attica, in the evening of the day
before<a id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> the ides of August; upon which day also the Dolphin
sets in Egypt, and, according to C&aelig;sar, in Italy. On the
eleventh<a id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> before the calends of September, the star called the
Vintager begins to rise in the morning, according to C&aelig;sar’s
reckoning, and to the people of Assyria: it announces the
ripening of the vintage, a sure sign of which is the change of
colour in the grape. On the fifth<a id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> before the calends of September,
the Arrow sets in Assyria, and the Etesian winds cease
to blow: on the nones<a id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> of September, the Vintager rises in
Egypt, and in the morning of that day, Arcturus rises to the
people of Attica: on the same morning, too, the Arrow sets.
In the fifth before<a id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> the ides of September, according to C&aelig;sar,
the She-Goat rises in the evening; and one half of Arcturus
becomes visible on the day before<a id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> the ides of September, being
portentous<a id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> of boisterous weather for five days, both by land
and sea.</p>

<p>The theory relative to the effects produced by Arcturus, is
stated in the following terms: if showers prevail, it is said, at
the setting of the Dolphin, they will not cease so long as
Arcturus is visible. The departure of the swallows may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
looked upon as the sign of the rising of Arcturus; for if overtaken
by it, they are sure to perish.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth day before<a id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> the calends of October, the
Ear of Corn, which Virgo holds, rises to the people of Egypt in
the morning, and by this day the Etesian winds have quite
ceased to blow. According to C&aelig;sar, this constellation rises on
the fourteenth<a id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> before the calends, and it affords its prognostics
to the Assyrians on the thirteenth. On the eleventh before<a id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a>
the calends of October, the point of junction<a id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> in Pisces disappears,
and upon the eighth<a id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> is the autumnal equinox. It is
a remarkable fact, and rarely the case, that Philippus, Callippus,
Dositheus, Parmeniscus, Conon,<a id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> Criton, Democritus, and
Eudoxus, all agree that the She-Goat rises in the morning of
the fourth before<a id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> the calends of October, and on the third<a id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a>
the Kids. On the sixth day before<a id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> the nones of October, the
Crown rises in the morning to the people of Attica, and upon
the morning of the fifth,<a id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> the Charioteer sets. On the fourth
before<a id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> the nones of October, the Crown, according to C&aelig;sar’s
reckoning, begins to rise, and on the evening of the day after
is the setting of the constellation of the Kids. On the eighth
before<a id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> the ides of October, according to C&aelig;sar, the bright
star rises that shines in the Crown, and on the evening of the
sixth before<a id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> the ides the Vergili&aelig;, rise. Upon the ides<a id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> of
October, the Crown has wholly risen. On the seventeenth before<a id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>
the calends of November, the Sucul&aelig; rise in the evening,
and on the day before the calends, according to C&aelig;sar’s reckoning,
Arcturus sets, and the Sucul&aelig;<a id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> rise with the sun. In the
evening of the fourth day before<a id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> the nones of November,
Arcturus sets. On the fifth before<a id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> the ides of November,
Orion’s Sword begins to set; and on the third<a id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> before the
ides the Vergili&aelig; set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>In this interval of time, the rural operations consist in sowing
rape and turnips, upon the days which have been mentioned on
a previous occasion.<a id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> The people in the country are of opinion,
that it is not a good plan to sow rape after the departure of the
stork; but for my own part, I am of opinion that it should
be sown after the Vulcanalia, and the early kind at the same
time as panic. After the setting of the Lyre, vetches should
be sown, kidney-beans and hay-grass: it is generally recommended
that this should be done while the moon is in conjunction.
This, too, is the proper time for gathering in the
leaves: it is fair work for one woodman, to fill four baskets<a id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a>
in the day. If the leaves are gathered while the moon is on
the wane, they will not decay; they ought not to be dry,
however, when gathered.</p>

<p>The ancients were of opinion, that the vintage is never ripe
before the equinox; but at the present day I find that it is
gathered in before that period; it will be as well, therefore,
to give the signs and indications by which the proper moment
may be exactly ascertained. The rules for getting in the vintage
are to the following effect: Never gather the grape in a
heated state,<a id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> or in other words, when the weather is dry, and
before the rains have fallen; nor ought it to be gathered when
covered with dew,—or in other words, when dews have fallen
during the night,—nor yet before the dews have been dispelled
by the sun. Commence the vintage when the bearing-shoots
begin to recline upon the stem, or when, after a grape is removed
from the bunch, the space left empty is not filled up;
this being a sure proof that the berry has ceased to increase in
size. It is of the greatest consequence to the grape, that it
should be gathered while the moon is on the increase. Each
pressing should fill twenty culei,<a id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> that being the fair proportion.
To fill twenty culei and vats<a id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> from twenty jugera of
vineyard, a single press will be enough. In pressing the grape,
some persons use a single press-board, but it is a better plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
to employ two, however large the single ones may be. It is the
length of them that is of the greatest consequence, and not the
thickness: if wide, however, they press the fruit all the better.
The ancients used to screw down the press-boards with ropes
and leather thongs, worked by levers. Within the last hundred
years the Greek press has been invented, with thick spiral
grooves running down the<a id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> stem. To this stem there are
spokes attached, which project like the rays of a star, and by
means of which the stem is made to lift a box filled with stones—a
method that is very highly approved of. It is only within
the last two-and-twenty years, that a plan has been discovered
of employing smaller press-boards, and a less unwieldy press:
to effect this, the height has been reduced, and the stem of the
screw placed in the middle, the whole pressure being concentrated
upon broad planks<a id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> placed over the grapes, which are
covered also with heavy weights above.</p>

<p>This is the proper time for gathering fruit; the best moment
for doing so is when it has begun to fall through ripeness,
and not from the effects of the weather. This is the season,
too, for extracting the lees of wine, and for boiling defrutum:<a id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a>
this last must be done on a night when there is no moon, or if
it is a full moon, in the day-time. At other times of the year,
it must be done either before the moon has risen, or after it
has set. The grapes employed for this purpose should never
be gathered from a young vine, nor yet from a tree that is
grown in a marshy spot, nor should any grapes be used but
those that are perfectly ripe: the liquor, too, should never be
skimmed with anything but a leaf,<a id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> for if the vessel should
happen to be touched with wood, the liquor, it is generally
thought, will have a burnt and smoky flavour.</p>

<p>The proper time for the vintage is between the equinox and
the setting of the Vergili&aelig;, a period of forty-four days. It is
a saying among the growers, that to pitch wine-vessels after
that day, in consequence of the coldness of the weather, is only
so much time lost. Still, however, I have seen, before now
persons getting in the vintage on the calends of January<a id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
even, in consequence of the want of wine-vessels, and putting
the must into receivers,<a id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> or else pouring the old wine out of
its vessels, to make room for new liquor of a very doubtful
quality. This, however, happens not so often in consequence
of an over-abundant crop, as through carelessness, or else the
avarice which leads people to wait for a rise in prices. The
method that is adopted by the most economical managers, is
to use the produce supplied by each year,<a id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> and this, too, is
found in the end the most lucrative mode of proceeding. As
for the other details relative to wines, they have been discussed
at sufficient length already;<a id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> and it has been stated on a previous
occasion,<a id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> that as soon as the vintage is got in, the olives
should at once be gathered, with other particulars relative
to the olive after the setting of the Vergili&aelig;.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_75"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 75. (32.)—THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON.</span></h3></div>

<p>I shall now proceed to add some necessary information relative
to the moon, the winds, and certain signs and prognostics,
in order that I may complete the observations I have to
make with reference to the sidereal system. Virgil<a id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> has even
gone so far, in imitation of Democritus, as to assign certain
operations to certain days<a id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> of the moon; but my sole object
shall be, as, indeed, it has been throughout this work, to consult
that utility which is based upon a knowledge and appreciation
of general principles.</p>

<p>All vegetable productions are cut, gathered, and housed to
more advantage while the moon is on the wane than while it
is on the increase. Manure must never be touched except
when the moon is on the wane; and land must be manured
more particularly while the moon is in conjunction, or else at
the first quarter. Take care to geld your boars, bulls, rams,
and kids, while the moon is on the wane. Put eggs under the
hen at a new moon. Make your ditches in the night-time,
when the moon is at full. Cover up the roots of trees, while
the moon is at full. Where the soil is humid, put in seed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
at the moon’s conjunction, and during the four days about
that period. It is generally recommended, too, to give an airing
to corn and the leguminous grains, and to garner them, towards
the end of the moon; to make seed-plots when the moon
is above the horizon; and to tread out the grape, to fell timber,
and to do many other things that have been mentioned
in their respective places, when the moon is below it.</p>

<p>The observation of the moon, in general, as already observed
in the Second Book,<a id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> is not so very easy, but what I
am about here to state even rustics will be able to comprehend:
so long as the moon is seen in the west, and during the earlier
hours of the night, she will be on the increase, and one half
of her disk will be perceived; but when the moon is seen to
rise at sunset and opposite to the sun, so that they are both
perceptible at the same moment, she will be at full. Again,
as often as the moon rises in the east, and does not give her
light in the earlier hours of the night, but shows herself
during a portion of the day, she will be on the wane, and one
half of her only will again be perceptible: when the moon has
ceased to be visible, she is in conjunction, a period known to
us as “interlunium.”<a id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> During the conjunction, the moon will
be above the horizon the same time as the sun, for the whole
of the first day; on the second, she will advance upon the
night ten-twelfths of an hour and one-fourth of a twelfth;<a id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>
on the third day, the same as on the second, and * * * so on
in succession up to the fifteenth day, the same proportional parts
of an hour being added each day. On the fifteenth day she will
be above the horizon all night, and below it all day. On the
sixteenth, she will remain below the horizon ten-twelfths of
an hour, and one-fourth of a twelfth, at the first hour of the
night, and so on in the same proportion day after day, up to
the period of her conjunction; and thus, the same time which,
by remaining under the horizon, she withdraws from the first
part of the night, she will add to the end of the night by
remaining above the horizon. Her revolutions, too, will
occupy thirty days one month, and twenty-nine the next, and
so on alternately. Such is the theory of the revolutions of
the moon.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_76"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 76. (33.)—THE THEORY OF THE WINDS.
</span></h3></div>

<p>The theory of the winds<a id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> is of a somewhat more intricate
nature. After observing the quarter in which the sun rises
on any given day, at the sixth<a id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> hour of the day take your
position in such a manner as to have the point of the sun’s
rising on your left; you will then have the south directly
facing you, and the north at your back: a line drawn through
a field in this direction<a id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> is called the “cardinal”<a id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> line. The
observer must then turn round, so as to look upon his shadow,
for it will be behind him. Having thus changed his position,
so as to bring the point of the sun’s rising on that day to the
right, and that of his setting to the left, it will be the sixth
hour of the day, at the moment when the shadow straight
before him is the shortest. Through the middle of this
shadow, taken lengthwise, a furrow must be traced in the
ground with a hoe, or else a line drawn with ashes, some
twenty feet in length, say; in the middle of this line, or, in
other words, at the tenth foot in it, a small circle must then
be described: to this circle we may give the name of the
“umbilicus,” or “navel.” That point in the line which lies
on the side of the head of the shadow will be the point from
which the north wind blows. You who are engaged in pruning
trees, be it your care that the incisions made in the wood
do not face this point; nor should the vine-trees<a id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> or the vines
have this aspect, except in the climates of Africa,<a id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> Cyren&aelig;, or
Egypt. When the wind blows, too, from this point, you must
never plough, nor, in fact, attempt any other of the operations
of which we shall have to make mention.<a id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<p>That part of the line which lies between the umbilicus and
the feet of the shadow will look towards the south, and indicate
the point from which the south wind<a id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> blows, to which,
as already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> the Greeks have given the name of
Notus. When the wind comes from this quarter, you, husbandman,
must never fell wood or touch the vine. In Italy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
this wind is either humid or else of a burning heat, and in
Africa it is accompanied with intense heat<a id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> and fine clear
weather. In Italy the bearing branches should be trained to
face this quarter, but the incisions made in the trees or vines
when pruned must never face it. Let those be on their guard
against this wind upon the four<a id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> days at the rising of the
Vergili&aelig;, who are engaged in planting the olive, as well as
those who are employed in the operations of grafting or inoculating.</p>

<p>It will be as well, too, here to give some advice, in reference
to the climate of Italy, as to certain precautions to be observed
at certain hours of the day. You, woodman, must never lop
the branches in the middle of the day; and you, shepherd,
when you see midday approaching in summer, and the shadow
gradually decreasing, drive your flocks from out of the sun
into some well-shaded spot. When you lead the flocks to pasture
in summer, let them face the west before midday,<a id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> and
after that time, the east: if this precaution is not adopted,
calamitous results will ensue; the same, too, if the flocks are
led in winter or spring to pastures covered with dew. Nor
must you let them feed with their faces to the north, as already
mentioned;<a id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> for the wind will either close their eyes or else
make them bleared, and they will die of looseness. If you wish
to have females,<a id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> you should let the dams have their faces towards
the north while being covered.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_77"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 77. (34.)—THE LAYING OUT OF LANDS ACCORDING TO THE
POINTS OF THE WIND.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> that the umbilicus should be described
in the middle of the line. Let another line be drawn
transversely through the middle of it, and it will be found to
run from due east to due west; a trench cut through the land
in accordance with this line is known by the name of “decumanus.”
Two other lines must then be traced obliquely
across them in the form of the letter X, in such a way as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
run exactly from right and left of the northern point to left
and right of the southern one. All these lines must pass
through the centre of the umbilicus, and all must be of corresponding
length, and at equal distances. This method should
always be adopted in laying out land; or if it should be found
necessary to employ it frequently, a plan<a id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> of it may be made
in wood, sticks of equal length being fixed upon the surface
of a small tambour,<a id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> but perfectly round. In the method
which I am here explaining, it is necessary to point out one
precaution that must always be observed by those who are
unacquainted with the subject. The point that must be verified
first of all is the south, as that is always the same; but
the sun, it must be remembered, rises every day at a point in
the heavens different to that of his rising on the day before,
so that the east must never be taken as the basis for tracing
the lines.</p>

<p>Having now ascertained the various points of the heavens,
the extremity of the line that is nearest to the north, but lying
to the east of it, will indicate the solstitial rising, or, in other
words, the rising of the sun on the longest day, as also the
point from which the wind Aquilo<a id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> blows, known to the Greeks
by the name of Boreas. You should plant all trees and vines
facing this point, but take care never to plough, or sow corn,
or plant in seed plots, while this wind is blowing, for it has the
effect of drying up and blasting the roots of the trees while
being transplanted. Be taught in time—one thing is good for
grown trees, another for them while they are but young. Nor
have I forgotten the fact, that it is at this point of the heavens
that the Greeks place the wind, to which they give the name
of C&aelig;cias; Aristotle, a man of most extensive learning, who
has assigned to C&aelig;cias this position, explains that it is in consequence
of the convexity of the earth, that Aquilo blows in
an opposite direction to the wind called Africus.</p>

<p>The agriculturist, however, has nothing to fear from Aquilo,
in respect to the operations before mentioned, all the year
through; for this wind is softened by the sun in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the summer, and, changing its name, is known by that of Etesias.<a id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a>
When you feel the cold, then, be on your guard; for,
whatever the noxious effects that are attributed to Aquilo, the
more sensibly will they be felt when the wind blows from due
north. In Asia, Greece, Spain, the coasts of Italy, Campania,
and Apulia, the trees that support the vines, as well as the
vines themselves, should have an aspect towards the north-east.
If you wish to have male produce, let the flock feed in such
a way, that this wind may have the opportunity of fecundating
the male, whose office it is to fecundate the females. The
wind Africus, known to the Greeks by the name of Libs, blows
from the south-west, the opposite point to Aquilo; when
animals, after coupling, turn their heads towards this quarter,<a id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a>
you may be sure that female produce has been conceived.</p>

<p>The third<a id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> line from the north, which we have drawn transversely
through the shadow, and called by the name of “decumanus,”
will point due east, and from this quarter the wind
Subsolanus blows, by the Greeks called Apeliotes. It is to
this point that, in healthy localities, farm-houses and vineyards
are made to look. This wind is accompanied with soft, gentle
showers; Favonius, however, the wind that blows from due
west, the opposite quarter to it, is of a drier nature; by the
Greeks it is known as Zephyrus. Cato has recommended that
olive-yards should look due west. It is this wind that begins
the spring, and opens the earth; it is moderately cool, but
healthy. As soon as it begins to prevail, it indicates that the
time has arrived for pruning the vine, weeding the corn, planting
trees, grafting fruit-trees, and trimming the olive; for its
breezes are productive of the most nutritious effects.</p>

<p>The fourth<a id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> line from the north, and the one that lies nearest
the south on the eastern side, will indicate the point of the
sun’s rising at the winter solstice, and the wind Volturnus,
known by the name of Eurus to the Greeks. This wind is
warm and dry, and beehives and vineyards, in the climates of
Italy and the Gallic provinces, should face this quarter.
Directly opposite to Volturnus, the wind Corus blows; it indicates
the point of the sun’s setting at the summer solstice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and lies on the western side next to the north. By the Greeks
it is called Argestes, and is one of the very coldest of the winds,
which, in fact, is the case with all the winds that blow from the
north; this wind, too, brings hailstorms with it, for which
reason it is necessary to be on our guard against it no less than
the north. If Volturnus begins to blow from a clear quarter
of the heavens, it will not last till night; but if it is Subsolanus,
it will prevail for the greater part of the night. Whatever
the wind that may happen to be blowing, if it is accompanied
by heat, it will be sure to last for several days. The
earth announces the approach of Aquilo, by drying on a sudden,
while on the approach of Auster, the surface becomes moist without any apparent cause.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_78"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 78. (35.)—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE SUN.</span></h3></div>

<p>Having now explained the theory of the winds, it seems to
me the best plan, in order to avoid any repetition, to pass on to
the other signs and prognostics that are indicative of a change
of weather. I find, too, that this is a kind of knowledge that
greatly interested Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> for he mentions the fact, that during
the harvest even, he has often seen the winds engage in a
combat that was absolutely ruinous to the improvident agriculturist.
There is a tradition, too, to the effect that Democritus,
already mentioned, when his brother Damasus was getting
in his harvest in extremely hot weather, entreated him to
leave the rest of the crop, and house with all haste that which
had been cut; and it was only within a very few hours that
his prediction was verified by a most violent storm. On the
other hand, it is particularly recommended never to plant reeds
except when rain is impending, and only to sow corn just before
a shower; we shall therefore briefly touch upon the prognostics
of this description, making enquiry more particularly
into those among them that have been found the most useful.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, we will consider those prognostics
of the weather which are derived from the sun.<a id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> If the sun is
bright at its rising, and not burning hot, it is indicative of fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
weather, but if pale, it announces wintry weather accompanied
with hail. If the sun is bright and clear when it sets, and
if it rises with a similar appearance, the more assured of fine
weather may we feel ourselves. If it is hidden in clouds at
its rising, it is indicative of rain, and of wind, when the clouds
are of a reddish colour just before sunrise; if black clouds are
intermingled with the red ones, they betoken rain as well.
When the sun’s rays at its rising or setting appear to unite,
rainy weather may be looked for. When the clouds are red at
sunset, they give promise<a id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> of a fine day on the morrow; but
if, at the sun’s rising, the clouds are dispersed in various quarters,
some to the south, and some to the north-east, even though
the heavens in the vicinity of the sun may be bright, they are
significant of rain and wind. If at the sun’s rising or setting,
its rays appear contracted, they announce the approach of
a shower. If it rains at sunset, or if the sun’s rays attract the
clouds towards them, it is portentous of stormy weather on the
following day. When the sun, at its rising, does not emit
vivid rays, although there are no clouds surrounding it, rain
may be expected. If before sunrise the clouds collect into
dense masses, they are portentous of a violent storm; but if
they are repelled from the east and travel westward, they indicate
fine weather. When clouds are seen surrounding the
face of the sun, the less the light they leave, the more violent
the tempest will be: but if they form a double circle round
the sun, the storm will be a dreadful one. If this takes place
at sunrise or sunset, and the clouds assume a red hue, the approach
of a most violent storm is announced: and if the clouds
hang over the face of the sun without surrounding it, they
presage wind from the quarter from which they are drifting,
and rain as well, if they come from the south.</p>

<p>If, at its rising, the sun is surrounded with a circle, wind
may be looked for in the quarter in which the circle breaks;
but if it disappears equally throughout, it is indicative of fine
weather. If the sun at its rising throws out its rays afar
through the clouds, and the middle of its disk is clear, there
will be rain; and if its rays are seen before it rises, both rain
and wind as well. If a white circle is seen round the sun at
its setting, there will be a slight storm in the night; but if there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
is a mist around it, the storm will be more violent. If the sun
is pale at sunset, there will be wind, and if there is a dark
circle round it, high winds will arise in the quarter in which the circle breaks.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_79"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 79.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE MOON.</span></h3></div>

<p>The prognostics derived from the moon, assert their right to
occupy our notice in the second place. In Egypt, attention is
paid, more particularly, to the fourth day of the moon. If,
when the moon rises, she shines with a pure bright light, it is
generally supposed that we shall have fine weather; but if she
is red, there will be wind, and if of a swarthy<a id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> hue, rain. If
upon the fifth day of the moon her horns are obtuse, they are
always indicative of rain, but if sharp and erect, of wind, and
this on the fourth day of the moon more particularly. If her
northern horn is pointed and erect, it portends wind; and if it
is the lower horn that presents this appearance, the wind will
be from the south; if both of them are erect, there will be
high winds in the night. If upon the fourth day of the moon
she is surrounded by a red circle, it is portentous of wind and
rain.</p>

<p>In Varro we find it stated to the following effect:—“If, at
the fourth day of the moon, her horns are erect, there will be
great storms at sea, unless, indeed, she has a circlet<a id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> around her,
and that circlet unblemished; for by that sign we are informed
that there will be no stormy weather before full moon. If, at
the full moon, one half of her disk is clear, it is indicative of
fine weather, but if it is red, of wind, and if black, of rain. If
a darkness comes over the face of the moon, covered with clouds,
in whatever quarter it breaks, from that quarter wind may be
expected. If a twofold circle surrounds the moon, the storm
will be more violent, and even more so still, if there are three
circles, or if they are black, broken, and disjointed. If the new
moon at her rising has the upper horn obscured, there will be a
prevalence of rainy weather, when she is on the wane; but if
it is the lower horn that is obscured, there will be rain before
full moon; if, again, the moon is darkened in the middle of her
disk, there will be rain when she is at full. If the moon, when
full, has a circle round her, it indicates wind from the quarter
in the circle which is the brightest; but if at her rising the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
horns are obtuse, they are portentous of a frightful tempest.
If, when the west wind prevails, the moon does not make her
appearance before her fourth day, there will be a prevalence
of stormy weather throughout the month. If on the sixteenth
day the moon has a bright, flaming appearance, it is a presage
of violent tempests.”</p>

<p>There are eight different epochs of the moon, or periods at
which she makes certain angles of incidence with the sun, and
most persons only notice the prognostics derived from the
moon, according to the places which they occupy between these
angles. The periods of these angles are the third day, the
seventh, the eleventh, the fifteenth, the nineteenth, the twenty-third,
the twenty-seventh, and that of the conjunction.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_80"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 80.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE STARS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the third rank must be placed the prognostics derived
from the stars. These bodies are sometimes to be seen shooting
to and fro;<a id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> when this happens, winds immediately ensue,
in that part of the heavens in which the presage has been
afforded. When the heavens are equally bright throughout
their whole expanse, at the periods previously mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> the
ensuing autumn will be fine and cool. If the spring and summer
have passed not without some rain, the autumn will be
fine and settled,<a id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> and there will be but little wind: when the
autumn is fine, it makes a windy winter. When the brightness
of the stars is suddenly obscured, though without<a id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> clouds
or fog, violent tempests may be expected. If numerous stars
are seen to shoot,<a id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> leaving a white track behind them, they
presage wind from that quarter.<a id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> If they follow in quick succession
from the same quarter, the wind will blow steadily,
but if from various quarters of the heavens, the wind will shift
in sudden gusts and squalls. If circles are seen to surround
any of the planets, there will be rain.<a id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> In the constellation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
of Cancer, there are two small stars to be seen, known as the
Aselli,<a id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> the small space that lies between them being occupied
by a cloudy appearance, which is known as the Manger;<a id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> when
this cloud is not visible in a clear sky, it is a presage of a
violent storm. If a fog conceals from our view the one of these
stars which lies to the north-east, there will be high winds from
the south; but if it is the star which lies to the south that is so
obscured, then the wind will be from the north-east. The
rainbow, when double, indicates the approach<a id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> of rain; but
if seen after rain, it gives promise, though by no means a certain
one, of fine weather. Circular clouds around some of the
stars are indicative of rain.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_81"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 81.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THUNDER.</span></h3></div>

<p>When, in summer, there is more thunder than lightning,
wind may be expected from that quarter; but if, on the other
hand, there is not so much thunder as lightning, there will be
a fall of rain. When it lightens in a clear sky, there will be
rain, and if there is thunder as well, stormy weather; but if
it lightens from all four quarters of the heavens, there will
be a dreadful tempest. When it lightens from the north-east
only, it portends rain on the following day; but when from
the north, wind may be expected from that quarter. When it
lightens on a clear night from the south, the west, or the
north-west, there will be wind and rain from those quarters.
Thunder<a id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> in the morning is indicative of wind, and at midday
of rain.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_82"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 82.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM CLOUDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>When clouds are seen moving in a clear sky, wind may be
expected in the quarter from which they proceed; but if they
accumulate in one spot, as they approach the sun they will
disperse. If the clouds are dispersed by a north-east wind, it
is a presage of high winds, but if by a wind from the south, of
rain. If at sunset the clouds cover the heavens on either side
of the sun, they are indicative of tempest; if they are black
and lowering in the east, they threaten rain in the night, but
if in the west, on the following day. If the clouds spread in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
large numbers from the east, like fleeces of wool in appearance,
they indicate a continuance of rain for the next three days.
When the clouds settle on the summits of the mountains,<a id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> there
will be stormy weather; but if the clouds clear away, it will
be fine. When the clouds are white and lowering, a hailstorm,
generally known as a “white”<a id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> tempest, is close at
hand. An isolated cloud, however small,<a id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> though seen in a
clear sky, announces wind and storm.</p>

<p>Next to these are the prognostics that are derived from fire
kindled upon the earth.<a id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> If the flames are pallid, and emit a

sign of rain.<a id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> If the flame is spiral and flickering, it is an indication
of wind, and the same is the case when the lamp goes
out of itself, or is lighted with difficulty. So, too, if the snuff
hangs down, and sparks gather upon it, or if the burning coals
adhere<a id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> to vessels taken from off the fire, or if the fire, when
covered up, sends out hot embers or emits sparks, or if the cinders
gather into a mass upon the hearth, or the coals burn
bright and glowing.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_85"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 85.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM WATER.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are certain prognostics, too, that may be derived from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
water. If, when the sea is calm, the water ripples in the harbour,
with a hollow, murmuring noise, it is a sign of wind,
and if in winter, of rain as well. If the coasts and shores re-echo
while the sea is calm, a violent tempest may be expected;
and the same when the sea, though calm, is heard to roar, or
throws up foam and bubbling spray. If sea pulmones<a id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> are
to be seen floating on the surface, they are portentous of stormy
weather for many days to come. Very frequently, too, the sea
is seen to swell in silence, and more so than when ruffled by an
ordinary breeze; this is an indication that the winds are at
work within its bosom already.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_86"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 86.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM TEMPESTS THEMSELVES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The reverberations, too, of the mountains, and the roaring
of the forests, are indicative of certain ph&aelig;nomena; and the
same is the case when the leaves are seen to quiver,<a id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> without
a breath of wind, the downy filaments of the poplar or thorn
to float in the air, and feathers to skim along the surface of
the water.<a id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> In champaign countries, the storm gives notice of
its approach by that peculiar muttering<a id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> which precedes it;
while the murmuring that is heard in the heavens affords us no
doubtful presage of what is to come.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XVIII_CHAP_87"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 87.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM AQUATIC ANIMALS,
AND BIRDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The animals, too, afford us certain presages; dolphins, for
instance, sporting in a calm sea, announce wind in the quarter
from which they make their appearance.<a id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> When they throw
up the water in a billowy sea, they announce the approach of
a calm. The loligo,<a id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> springing out of the water, shell-fish
adhering to various objects, sea-urchins fastening by their
stickles upon the sand, or else burrowing in it, are so many
indications<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of stormy weather: the same, too, when frogs<a id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> croak
more than usual, or coots<a id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> make a chattering in the morning.
Divers, too, and ducks, when they clean their feathers with
the bill, announce high winds; which is the case also when the
aquatic birds unite in flocks, cranes make for the interior, and
divers<a id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> and sea-mews forsake the sea or the creeks. Cranes
when they fly aloft in silence announce fine weather, and so
does the owlet,<a id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> when it screeches during a shower; but if it
is heard in fine weather, it presages a storm. Ravens, too,
when they croak with a sort of gurgling noise and shake their
feathers, give warning of the approach of wind, if their
note is continuous: but if, on the other hand, it is smothered,
and only heard at broken intervals, we may expect rain, accompanied
with high winds. Jackdaws, when they return
late from feeding, give notice of stormy weather, and the same
with the white birds,<a id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> when they unite in flocks, and the
land birds, when they descend with cries to the water and
besprinkle themselves, the crow more particularly. The
swallow,<a id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> too, when it skims along the surface of the water
so near as to ripple it every now and then with its wings, and
the birds that dwell in the trees, when they hide themselves
in their nests, afford similar indications; geese, too, when
they set up a continuous gabbling,<a id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> at an unusual time, and
the heron,<a id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> when it stands moping in the middle of the sands.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, is it surprising that the aquatic birds, or any

and frisk with their clumsy gambols,<a id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> afford us similar prognostics;
oxen, when they snuff upwards towards the sky, and
lick<a id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> themselves against the hair; unclean swine, when they
tear to pieces the trusses of hay that are put for other animals;<a id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1.—THE NATURE OF FLAX—MARVELLOUS FACTS RELATIVE
THERETO.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now imparted a knowledge<a id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> of the constellations
and of the seasons, in a method unattended with difficulty for
the most ignorant even, and free from every doubt; indeed,
to those who understand these matters aright, the face of the
earth contributes in no less a degree to a due appreciation of
the celestial ph&aelig;nomena, than does the science of astronomy
to our improvement in the arts of agriculture.</p>

<p>Many writers have made it their next care to treat of horticulture;
but, for my own part, it does not appear to me altogether
advisable to pass on immediately to that subject, and,
indeed, I am rather surprised to find that some among the
learned, who have either sought the pleasures of knowledge in
these pursuits, or have grounded their celebrity upon them,
have omitted so many particulars in reference thereto; for no
mention do we find in their writings of numerous vegetable
productions, both wild as well as cultivated, many of which
are found, in ordinary life, to be of higher value and of more
extended use to man than the cereals even.</p>

<p>To commence, then, with a production which is of an utility
that is universally recognized, and is employed not only
upon dry land but upon the seas as well, we will turn our attention
to flax,<a id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> a plant which is reproduced from seed, but
which can neither be classed among the cereals nor yet among
the garden plants. What department is there to be found of
active life in which flax is not employed? and in what production
of the earth are there greater marvels<a id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> revealed to us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
than in this? To think that here is a plant which brings
Egypt in close proximity to Italy!—so much so, in fact, that
Galerius<a id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> and Balbillus,<a id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> both of them prefects of Egypt, made
the passage to Alexandria from the Straits of Sicily, the one
in six days, the other in five! It was only this very last summer,
that Valerius Marianus, a senator of pr&aelig;torian rank,
reached Alexandria from Puteoli in eight days, and that, too,
with a very moderate breeze all the time! To think that
here is a plant which brings Gades, situate near the Pillars of
Hercules, within six days of Ostia, Nearer Spain within three,
the province of Gallia Narbonensis within two, and Africa
within one!—this last passage having been made by C. Flavius,
when legatus of Vibius Crispus, the proconsul, and that,
too, with but little or no wind to favour his passage!</p>

<p>What audacity in man! What criminal perverseness! thus
to sow a thing in the ground for the purpose of catching the
winds and the tempests, it being not enough for him, forsooth,
to be borne upon the waves alone! Nay, still more than this,
sails even that are bigger than the very ships themselves will
not suffice for him, and although it takes a whole tree to
make a mast to carry the cross-yards, above those cross-yards
sails upon sails must still be added, with others swelling at the
prow and at the stern as well—so many devices, in fact, to
challenge death! Only to think, in fine, that that which
moves to and fro, as it were, the various countries of the earth,
should spring from a seed so minute, and make its appearance
in a stem so fine, so little elevated above the surface of the
earth! And then, besides, it is not in all its native strength
that it is employed for the purposes of a tissue; no, it must
first be rent asunder, and then tawed and beaten, till it is
reduced to the softness of wool; indeed, it is only by such
violence done to its nature, and prompted by the extreme
audacity of man, and<a id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> * * * that it is rendered subservient
to his purposes. The inventor of this art has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
already mentioned by us on a more appropriate occasion;<a id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> not
satisfied that his fellow-men should perish upon land, but
anxious that they should meet their end with no sepulchral
rites to await them, there are no execrations<a id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> to be found that
can equal his demerits!</p>

<p>It is only in the preceding Book<a id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> that I was warning the
agriculturist, as he values the grain that is to form our daily
sustenance, to be on his guard against the storm and the tempest;
and yet, here we have man sowing with his own hand,
man racking his invention how best to gather, an object the
only aspirations of which upon the deep are the winds of
heaven! And then, too, as if to let us understand all the better
how highly favoured is this instrument of our punishment,
there is no vegetable production that grows with greater facility;<a id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a>
and, to prove to us that it is in despite of Nature herself
that it exists, it has the property of scorching<a id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> the ground
where it is grown, and of deteriorating the quality of the very
soil itself.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2. (1.)—HOW FLAX IS SOWN: TWENTY-SEVEN PRINCIPAL
VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Flax is mostly sown in sandy<a id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> soils, and after a single
ploughing only. There is no plant that grows more rapidly<a id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
than this; sown in spring,<a id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> it is pulled up in summer, and is,
for this reason as well, productive of considerable injury to the
soil.<a id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> There may be some, however, who would forgive
Egypt for growing it, as it is by its aid that she imports the
merchandize of Arabia and India; but why should the Gallic
provinces base any of their reputation upon this product?<a id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> Is
it not enough, forsooth, for them to be separated by mountains
from the sea, and to have, upon the side on which they are
bounded by the Ocean, that void and empty space, as it is
called?<a id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> The Cadurci,<a id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> the Caleti, the Ruteni,<a id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> the Bituriges,<a id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a>
and the Morini,<a id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> those remotest of all mankind, as it is
supposed, the whole of the Gallic provinces, in fact, are in the
habit of weaving sail-cloth; and at the present day our enemies
even, who dwell beyond the Rhenus, have learned to do the
same; indeed, there is no tissue that is more beautiful in the
eyes of their females than linen. I am here reminded of the
fact, that we find it stated by M. Varro, that it is a custom
peculiar to the family of the Serrani<a id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> for the women never to
wear garments of linen. In Germany it is in caves<a id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> deep under-ground
that the linen-weavers ply their work; and the same
is the case, too, in the Alian territory, in Italy, between the
rivers Padus and Ticinus, the linen of which holds the third
rank among the kinds manufactured in Europe, that of S&aelig;tabis<a id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>
claiming the first, and those of Retovium<a id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> and of Faventia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in the vicinity of Alia, on the &AElig;milian Way, the second,
place in general estimation. The linens of Faventia are preferred
for whiteness to those of Alia, which are always un-bleached:
those of Retovium are remarkable for their extreme
fineness, combined with substance, and are quite equal in
whiteness to the linens of Faventia; but they have none of
that fine downy nap<a id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> upon them, which is so highly esteemed
by some persons, though equally disliked by others. A thread
is made, too, from their flax, of considerable strength, smoother
and more even, almost, than the spider’s web; when tested
with the teeth, it emits a sharp, clear twang; hence it is, that
it sells at double the price of the other kinds.</p>

<p>But it is the province of Nearer Spain that produces a linen
of the greatest lustre, an advantage which it owes to the waters
of a stream which washes the city of Tarraco<a id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> there. The fineness,
too, of this linen is quite marvellous, and here it is that
the first manufactories of cambric<a id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> were established. From
the same province, too, of Spain, the flax of Zo&euml;la<a id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> has of late
years been introduced into Italy, and has been found extremely
serviceable for the manufacture of hunting-nets. Zo&euml;la is a
city of Call&aelig;cia, in the vicinity of the Ocean. The flax, too,
of Cum&aelig;, in Campania, has its own peculiar merits in the
manufacture of nets for fishing and fowling; it is employed,
also, for making hunting-nets. For it is from flax, in fact,
that we prepare various textures, destined to be no less insidious
to the brute creation than they are to ourselves. It is
with toils made from the flax of Cum&aelig; that wild boars are
taken, the meshes being proof against their bristles,<a id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> equally
with the edge of the knife: before now, too, we have seen some
of these toils of a fineness so remarkable<a id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> as to allow of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
passed through a man’s ring, running ropes and all, a single
individual being able to carry an amount of nets sufficient to
environ a whole forest—a thing which we know to have been
done not long ago by Julius Lupus, who died prefect of Egypt.
This, however, is nothing very surprising, but it really is quite
wonderful that each of the cords was composed of no less
than one hundred and fifty threads. Those, no doubt, will be
astonished at this, who are not aware that there is preserved
in the Temple of Minerva, at Lindus, in the Isle of Rhodes,
the cuirass of a former king of Egypt, Amasis by name, each
thread employed in the texture of which is composed of three
hundred and sixty-five other threads. Mucianus, who was
three times consul, informs us that he saw this curiosity very
recently, though there was but little then remaining of it, in
consequence of the injury it had experienced at the hands of
various persons who had tried to verify the fact. Italy, too,
holds the flax of the Peligni in high esteem, though it is only
employed by fullers; there is no kind known that is whiter
than this, or which bears a closer resemblance to wool. That
grown by the Cadurci<a id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> is held in high estimation for making
mattresses;<a id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> which, as well as flock,<a id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> are an invention for which
we are indebted to the Gauls: the ancient usage of Italy is
still kept in remembrance in the word “stramentum,”<a id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> the
name given by us to beds stuffed with straw.</p>

<p>The flax of Egypt, though the least strong<a id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> of all as a tissue,
is that from which the greatest profits are derived. There are
four varieties of it, the Tanitic, the Pelusiac, the Butic, and
the Tentyritic—so called from the various districts in which
they are respectively grown. The upper part of Egypt, in
the vicinity of Arabia, produces a shrub, known by some as
“gossypium,”<a id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> but by most persons as “xylon;” hence the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
name of “xylina,” given to the tissues that are manufactured
from it. The shrub is small, and bears a fruit, similar in
appearance to a nut with a beard, and containing in the inside
a silky substance, the down of which is spun into threads.
There is no tissue known, that is superior to those made from
this thread, either for whiteness, softness, or dressing: the
most esteemed vestments worn by the priests of Egypt are
made of it. There is a fourth kind of tissue, known by the
name of “othoninum,” which is made from a kind of marsh-reed,<a id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>
the panicule only being employed for the purpose. In
Asia, again, there is a thread made from broom,<a id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> which is
employed in the construction of fishing-nets, being found to
be remarkably durable; for the purpose of preparing it, the
shrub is steeped in water for ten days. The &AElig;thiopians, also,
and the people of India, prepare a kind of thread from a fruit
which resembles our apple, and the Arabians, as already<a id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> mentioned,
from gourds that grow upon trees.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 3.—THE MODE OF PREPARING FLAX.</span></h3></div>

<p>In our part of the world the ripeness of flax is usually
ascertained by two signs, the swelling of the seed, and its
assuming a yellowish tint. It is then pulled up by the roots,
made up into small sheaves that will just fill the hand, and
hung to dry in the sun. It is suspended with the roots
upwards the first day, and then for the five following days the
heads of the sheaves are placed, reclining one against the other,
in such a way that the seed which drops out may fall into the
middle. Linseed is employed for various medicinal<a id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> purposes,
and it is used by the country-people of Italy beyond the Padus
in a certain kind of food, which is remarkable for its sweetness:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
for this long time past, however, it has only been in general
use for sacrifices offered to the divinities. After the wheat
harvest is over, the stalks of flax are plunged in water that
has been warmed in the sun, and are then submitted to pressure
with a weight; for there is nothing known that is more
light and buoyant than this. When the outer coat is loosened,
it is a sign that the stalks have been sufficiently steeped; after
which<a id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> they are again turned with the heads downwards, and
left to dry as before in the sun: when thoroughly dried, they
are beaten with a tow-mallet on a stone.</p>

<p>The part that lies nearest to the outer coat is known by the
name of “stuppa;” it is a flax of inferior quality, and is
mostly employed for making the wicks of lamps. This, however,
requires to be combed out with iron hatchels, until the
whole of the outer skin is removed. The inner part presents
numerous varieties of flax, esteemed respectively in proportion
to their whiteness and their softness. Spinning flax is
held to be an honourable<a id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> employment for men even: the
husks, or outer coats, are employed for heating furnaces and
ovens. There is a certain amount of skill required in hatchelling
flax and dressing it: it is a fair proportion for fifty pounds
in the sheaf to yield fifteen pounds of flax combed out. When
spun into thread, it is rendered additionally supple by being
soaked in water and then beaten out upon a stone; and after
it is woven into a tissue, it is again beaten with heavy maces:
indeed, the more roughly it is treated the better it is.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 4.—LINEN MADE OF ASBESTOS.</span></h3></div>

<p>There has been invented also a kind of linen which is incombustible
by flame. It is generally known as “live”<a id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> linen,
and I have seen, before now, napkins<a id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> that were made of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
thrown into a blazing fire, in the room where the guests were
at table, and after the stains were burnt out, come forth from
the flames whiter and cleaner than they could possibly have
been rendered by the aid of water. It is from this material
that the corpse-cloths of monarchs are made, to ensure the
separation of the ashes of the body from those of the pile.
This substance grows<a id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> in the deserts of India,<a id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> scorched by
the burning rays of the sun: here, where no rain is ever
known to fall, and amid multitudes of deadly serpents, it becomes
habituated to resist the action of fire. Rarely to be
found, it presents considerable difficulties in weaving it into a
tissue, in consequence of its shortness; its colour is naturally
red, and it only becomes white through the agency of fire.
By those who find it, it is sold at prices equal to those given
for the finest pearls; by the Greeks it is called “asbestinon,”<a id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a>
a name which indicates its peculiar properties. Anaxila&uuml;s<a id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a>
makes a statement to the effect that if a tree is surrounded
with linen made of this substance, the noise of the blows
given by the axe will be deadened thereby, and that the tree may
be cut down without their being heard. For these qualities it
is that this linen occupies the very highest rank among all the
kinds that are known.</p>

<p>The next rank is accorded to the tissue known as “byssus,”<a id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a>
an article which is held in the very highest estimation by
females, and is produced in the vicinity of Elis, in Achaia.<a id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> I
find it stated by some writers that a scruple of this sold formerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
at four denarii, the same rate, in fact, as gold. The
downy nap of linen, and more particularly that taken from
the sails of sea-going ships, is very extensively employed for
medicinal purposes, and the ashes of it have the same virtues
as spodium.<a id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> Among the poppies, too,<a id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> there is a variety which
imparts a remarkable degree of whiteness to fabrics made of
linen.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 5.—AT WHAT PERIOD LINEN WAS FIRST DYED.</span></h3></div>

<p>Attempts, too, have even been made to dye linen, and to
make it assume the frivolous colours<a id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> of our cloths. This was
first done in the fleet of Alexander the Great, while sailing
upon the river Indus; for, upon one occasion, during a battle
that was being fought, his generals and captains distinguished
their vessels by the various tints of their sails, and astounded
the people on the shores by giving their many colours to the
breeze, as it impelled them on. It was with sails of purple,
too, that Cleopatra accompanied M. Antonius to the battle of
Actium, and it was by their aid that she took to flight: such
being the distinguishing mark of the royal ship.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 6.—AT WHAT PERIOD COLOURED AWNINGS WERE FIRST
EMPLOYED IN THE THEATRES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In more recent<a id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> times linens alone have been employed
for the purpose of affording shade in our theatres; Q. Catulus
having been the first who applied them to this use, on
the occasion of the dedication by him of the Capitol. At a
later period, Lentulus Spinther, it is said, was the first to
spread awnings of fine linen<a id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> over the theatre, at the celebration
of the Games in honour of Apollo. After this, C&aelig;sar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
when Dictator, covered with a linen awning the whole of the
Roman Forum, as well as the Sacred Way, from his own house
as far as the ascent to the Capitol, a sight, it is said, more wonderful
even than the show of gladiators which he then exhibited.
At a still later period, and upon the occasion of no
public games, Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augustus,
during his &aelig;dileship, and in the eleventh consulship of his
uncle, on the * * * day before the calends of August, covered
in the Forum with awnings, his object being to consult the
health of those assembled there for the purposes of litigation—a
vast change, indeed, from the manners prevalent in the
days of Cato the Censor, who expressed a wish that the
Forum was paved with nothing else but sharp pointed stones.</p>

<p>Awnings have been lately extended, too, by the aid of ropes,
over the amphitheatres of the Emperor Nero, dyed azure, like
the heavens, and bespangled all over with stars. Those which
are employed by us to cover the inner court<a id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> of our houses
are generally red: one reason for employing them is to protect
the moss that grows there from the rays<a id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> of the sun. In
other respects, white fabrics of linen have always held the
ascendancy in public estimation. Linen, too, was highly
valued as early as the Trojan war; for why else should it not
have figured as much in battles as it did in shipwrecks? Thus
Homer,<a id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> we find, bears witness that there were but few among
the warriors of those days who fought with cuirasses<a id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> on
made of linen; while, as for the rigging of the ships, of
which that writer speaks, it is generally supposed by the more
learned among the commentators, that it was made of this material;
for the word “sparta,”<a id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> which he employs, means
nothing more than the produce of a seed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_7"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 7. (2.)—THE NATURE OF SPARTUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>For the fact is that spartum<a id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> did not begin to be employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
till many ages after the time of Homer; indeed, not before the
first war that the Carthaginians waged in Spain. This, too,
is a plant that grows spontaneously,<a id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> and is incapable of being
reproduced by sowing, it being a species of rush, peculiar to a
dry, arid soil, a morbid production confined to a single country
only; for in reality it is a curse to the soil, as there is nothing
whatever that can be sown or grown in its vicinity. There is
a kind of spartum grown in Africa,<a id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> of a stunted nature, and
quite useless for all practical purposes. It is found in one
portion of the province of Carthage<a id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> in Nearer Spain, though
not in every part of that; but wherever it is produced, the
mountains, even, are covered all over with it.</p>

<p>This material is employed by the country-people there for
making<a id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> their beds; with it they kindle their fires also, and
prepare their torches; shoes<a id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> also, and garments for the shepherds,
are made of it. As a food for animals, it is highly injurious,<a id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a>
with the sole exception of the tender tops of the
shoots. When wanted for other uses, it is pulled up by the
roots, with considerable labour; the legs of the persons so employed
being protected by boots, and their hands with gloves,
the plant being twisted round levers of bone or holm-oak, to
get it up with the greater facility. At the present day it is
gathered in the winter, even; but this work is done with the
least difficulty between the ides of May<a id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> and those of June,
that being the period at which it is perfectly ripe.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 8.—THE MODE OF PREPARING SPARTUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>When taken up it is made into sheaves, and laid in heaps
for a couple of days, while it retains its life and freshness; on
the third day the sheaves are opened out and spread in the sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to dry, after which it is again made up into sheaves, and placed
under cover. It is then put to soak in sea-water, this being the
best of all for the purpose, though fresh water will do in case
sea-water cannot be procured: this done, it is again dried in
the sun, and then moistened afresh. If it is wanted for immediate
use, it is put in a tub and steeped in warm water, after
which it is placed in an upright position to dry: this being
universally admitted to be the most expeditious method of preparing
it. To make it ready for use, it requires to be beaten
out. Articles made of it are proof, more particularly, against
the action of fresh or sea-water; but on dry land, ropes of hemp
are generally preferred. Indeed, we find that spartum receives
nutriment even from being under water, by way of compensation,
as it were, for the thirst it has had to endure upon its
native soil.</p>

<p>By nature it is peculiarly well adapted for repairing, and
however old the material may be, it unites very well with new.
The person, indeed, who is desirous duly to appreciate this
marvellous plant, has only to consider the numerous uses to
which, in all parts of the world, it is applied: from it are
made, the rigging of ships, various appliances of mechanism
employed in building, and numerous other articles which supply
the wants of daily life. To suffice for all these requirements,
we find it growing solely on a tract of ground which lies upon
the sea-line of the province of New Carthage, somewhat less
than thirty miles in breadth by one hundred in length. The
expense precludes its being transported to any very considerable
distance.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 9.—AT WHAT PERIOD SPARTUM WAS FIRST EMPLOYED.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Greeks used formerly to employ the rush for making
ropes; so, at least, we are led to believe, from the name<a id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> given
by them to that plant; and at a later period they made them,
it is very clear, from the leaves of the palm, and the inner
bark of the linden-tree. It seems to me very probable, too,
that it was from them that the Carthaginians borrowed the
first hint for applying spartum to a similar purpose.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_10"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 10.—THE BULB ERIOPHORUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> informs us, that there is a kind of bulb, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
grows on the banks of rivers, and which encloses between the
outer coat and the portion that is eaten a sort of woolly substance,
of which felt socks, and other articles of dress, are made;
but, in the copies, those at least which have fallen in my way,
there is no mention made of the country in which it grows, or
of any details in connection with it, beyond the fact that
the name given to it is “eriophoron.”<a id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> As to spartum,
he makes no<a id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> mention of it whatever, although he has given
the history, with the greatest exactness, of all the known
plants, three hundred and ninety years before our time—a fact
to which I have already<a id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> alluded on other occasions: from
this it would appear that spartum has come into use since his
day.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_11"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 11.—PLANTS WHICH SPRING UP AND GROW WITHOUT A
ROOT—PLANTS WHICH GROW, BUT CANNOT BE REPRODUCED FROM
SEED.</span></h3></div>

<p>As we have here made a beginning of treating of the marvels
of Nature, we shall proceed to examine them in detail; and
among them the very greatest of all, beyond a doubt, is the
fact that any plant should spring up and grow without a root.
Such, for instance, is the vegetable production known as the
truffle;<a id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> surrounded on every side by earth, it is connected
with it by no fibres, not so much as a single thread even, while
the spot in which it grows, presents neither protuberance nor
cleft to the view. It is found, in fact, in no way adhering to
the earth, but enclosed within an outer coat; so much so, indeed,
that though we cannot exactly pronounce it to be composed
of earth, we must conclude that it is nothing else but a
callous<a id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> concretion of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Truffles generally grow in dry, sandy soils, and spots that
are thickly covered with shrubs; in size they are often larger
than a quince, and are found to weigh as much<a id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> as a pound.
There are two kinds of them, the one full of sand, and consequently
injurious to the teeth, the other free from sand and
all impurities. They are distinguished also by their colour,
which is red or black, and white within; those of Africa<a id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a>
are the most esteemed. Whether the truffle grows gradually,
or whether this blemish of the earth—for it can be looked upon
as nothing else—at once assumes the globular form and magnitude
which it presents when found; whether, too, it is possessed
of vitality or not, are all of them questions, which, in
my opinion, are not easy to be solved. It decays and rots in
a manner precisely similar to wood.</p>

<p>It is known to me as a fact, that the following circumstance
happened to Lartius Licinius, a person of pr&aelig;torian rank, while
minister of justice,<a id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> a few years ago, at Carthage in Spain;
upon biting a truffle, he found a denarius inside, which all but
broke his fore teeth—an evident proof that the truffle is nothing
else but an agglomeration of elementary earth. At all
events, it is quite certain that the truffle belongs to those
vegetable productions which spring up spontaneously, and are
incapable of being reproduced from seed.<a id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_12"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 12. (3.)—MISY; ITON; AND GERANION.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of a similar nature, too, is the vegetable production known
in the province of Cyrenaica by the name of “misy,”<a id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
for the sweetness of its smell and taste, but more
fleshy than the truffle: the same, too, as to the iton<a id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> of the
Thracians, and the geranion of the Greeks.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_13"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 13.—PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE TRUFFLE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The following peculiarities we find mentioned with reference
to the truffle. When there have been showers in autumn, and
frequent thunder-storms, truffles are produced, thunder<a id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> contributing
more particularly to their developement; they do
not, however, last beyond a year, and are considered the most
delicate eating when gathered in spring. In some places the
formation of them is attributed to water; as at Mytilene,<a id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> for
instance, where they are never to be found, it is said, unless
the rivers overflow, and bring down the seed from Tiara, that
being the name of a place at which they are produced in the
greatest abundance. The finest truffles of Asia are those found
in the neighbourhood of Lampsacus and Alopeconnesus; the
best in Greece are those of the vicinity of Elis.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_14"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 14.—THE PEZICA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Belonging to the mushroom genus, also, there is a species,
known to the Greeks by the name of “pezica,”<a id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> which grows
without either root or stalk.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_15"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 15.—LASERPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next to these, laserpitium<a id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> claims our notice, a very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
plant, known to the Greeks by the name of “silphion,”
and originally a native of the province of Cyrenaica.
The juice of this plant is called “laser,” and it is greatly in
vogue for medicinal as well as other purposes, being sold at
the same rate as silver. For these many years past, however,
it has not been found in Cyrenaica,<a id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> as the farmers of the
revenue who hold the lands there on lease, have a notion that
it is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them.
Within the memory of the present generation, a single stalk<a id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>
is all that has ever been found there, and that was sent as a
curiosity to the Emperor Nero. If it so happen that one of
the flock, while grazing, meets with a growing shoot<a id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> of it, the
fact is easily ascertained by the following signs; the sheep, after
eating of it, immediately falls asleep, while the goat is seized
with a fit of sneezing.<a id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> For this long time past, there has
been no other laser imported into this country, but that produced
in either Persis, Media, or Armenia, where it grows in
considerable abundance, though much inferior<a id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> to that of Cyrenaica;
and even then it is extensively adulterated with gum,
sacopenium,<a id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> or pounded beans. I ought the less then to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
omit the facts, that in the consulship<a id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> of C. Valerius and M.
Herennius, there was brought to Rome, from Cyren&aelig;, for the
public service, thirty pounds’ weight of laserpitium, and that
the Dictator C&aelig;sar, at the beginning of the Civil War, took
from out of the public treasury, besides gold and silver, no
less than fifteen hundred pounds of laserpitium.</p>

<p>We find it stated by the most trustworthy among the Greek
writers,<a id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> that this plant first made its appearance in the vicinity
of the gardens of the Hesperides and the Greater Syrtis, immediately
after the earth had been soaked on a sudden by a
shower as black as pitch. This took place seven years before
the foundation of the city of Cyren&aelig;, and in the year of Rome
143. The virtues of this remarkable fall of rain extended,
it is said, over no less than four thousand stadia of the African
territory; and upon this soil laserpitium began universally to
grow, a plant that is in general wild and stubborn, and which,
if attempted to be cultivated, will leave the spot where it has
been sown quite desolate and barren. The roots of it are
numerous and thick, the stalk being like that of fennel-giant,
and of similar thickness. The leaves of this plant were known
as “maspetum,” and bore a considerable resemblance to parsley;
the seeds of it were foliaceous, and the plant shed its leaves
every year. They used to feed the cattle there upon it; at
first it purged them, but afterwards they would grow fat, the
flesh being improved in flavour in a most surprising degree.
After the fall of the leaf, the people themselves were in the
habit of eating<a id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> the stalk, either roasted or boiled: from the
drastic effects of this diet the body was purged for the first
forty days, all vicious humours being effectually removed.<a id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a></p>

<p>The juices of this plant were collected two different ways,
either from the root or from the stalk; in consequence of which
these two varieties of the juice were known by the distinguishing
names of “rhizias” and “caulias,”<a id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> the last being of inferior
quality to the other, and very apt to turn putrid. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the root there was a black bark, which was extensively employed
for the purposes of adulteration. The juice of the
plant was received in vessels, and mixed there with a layer of
bran; after which, from time to time it was shaken, till it had
reached a proper state of maturity; indeed, if this precaution
was neglected, it was apt to turn putrid. The signs that it
had come to maturity were its colour, its dryness, and the absorption
of all humidity.</p>

<p>There are some authors, however, who state that the root of
laserpitium was more than a cubit in length, and that it presented
a tuberosity above the surface of the earth. An incision,
they say, was made in this tuberosity, from which a juice would
flow, like milk in appearance; above the tuberosity grew a
stalk, to which they give the name of “magydaris;”<a id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> the
leaves that grew upon this stalk were of the colour of gold, and,
falling at the rising of the Dog-star, when the south winds
begin to prevail, they acted as seed for the purposes of reproduction.
It was from these leaves, too, they say, that laserpitium<a id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a>
was produced, the root and the stalk attaining their
full growth in the space of one year. The same writers also
state, that it was the practice to turn up the ground about the
plant, and that it had no such effect as purging the cattle that
were fed upon it; though one result of using it as food was,
that such cattle as were ailing were either cured of their distempers,
or else died immediately upon eating of it, a thing,
however, that but rarely happened. The first description,
however, is found to agree more nearly with the silphium

<p>There is another<a id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> variety of this plant, known as “magydaris,”<a id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a>
of a more delicate nature, less active in its effects, and
destitute of juice. It grows in the countries adjacent to Syria,<a id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>
but is not to be found in the regions of Cyrenaica. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
grows also upon Mount Parnassus,<a id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> in great abundance, a plant
to which some persons give the name of “laserpitium:” by
means of all these varieties, adulterations are effected of a production
that is held in the highest esteem for its salutary
qualities and its general usefulness. The chief proofs of its
genuineness consist in its colour, which ought to be slightly
red without, and when broken quite white and transparent
within; the drops of it, too, should melt very rapidly on the
application of spittle. It is extensively employed for medicinal
purposes.<a id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_17"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 17.—MADDER.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are two other plants also, which are but little known
to any but the herd of the sordid and avaricious, and this because
of the large profits that are derived from them. The
first of these is madder,<a id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> the employment of which is necessary
in dyeing wool and leather. The madder of Italy is the
most esteemed, and that more particularly which is grown in
the suburbs of the City; nearly all our provinces, too, produce
it in great abundance.<a id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> It grows spontaneously, but is
capable of reproduction by sowing, much after the same manner
as the fitch. The stem,<a id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> however, is prickly, and articulated,
with five leaves arranged round each joint: the seed is
red. Its medicinal properties we shall have occasion to mention
in the appropriate place.<a id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_18"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 18.—THE RADICULA.</span></h3></div>

<p>The plant known to us by the name of “radicula,”<a id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
second of these productions. It furnishes a juice that is extensively
employed in washing wool, and it is quite wonderful
how greatly it contributes to the whiteness and softness of
wool. It may be produced anywhere by cultivation, but that
which grows spontaneously in Asia and Syria,<a id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> upon rugged,
rocky sites, is more highly esteemed. That, however, which
is found beyond the Euphrates has the highest repute of all.
The stalk of it is ferulaceous<a id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> and thin, and is sought by the
inhabitants of those countries as an article of food. It is employed
also for making unguents, being boiled up with the
other ingredients, whatever they may happen to be. In leaf
it strongly resembles the olive. The Greeks have given it the
name of “struthion.” It blossoms in summer, and is agreeable
to the sight, but entirely destitute of smell. It is somewhat
thorny, and has a stalk covered with down. It has an extremely
diminutive seed, and a large root, which is cut up and
employed for the purposes already mentioned.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_19"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 19. (4.)—THE PLEASURES OF THE GARDEN.</span></h3></div>

<p>Having made mention of these productions, it now remains
for us to return to the cultivation of the garden,<a id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> a subject
recommended by its own intrinsic merits to our notice: for we
find that in remote antiquity, even, there was nothing looked
upon with a greater degree of admiration than the gardens of
the Hesperides,<a id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> those of the kings Adonis<a id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> and Alcino&uuml;s,<a id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and the Hanging Gardens, whether they were the work of
Semiramis, or whether of Cyrus, king of Assyria, a subject of
which we shall have to speak in another work.<a id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> The kings of
Rome cultivated their gardens with their own hands; indeed,
it was from his garden that Tarquinius Superbus<a id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> sent to his
son that cruel and sanguinary message of his. In our laws of
the Twelve Tables, we find the word “villa,” or “farm,”
nowhere mentioned; it is the word “hortus” that is always
used with that signification, while the term “heredium” we
find employed for “garden.”</p>

<p>There are certain religious impressions, too, that have been
attached to this species of property,<a id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> and we find that it is in
the garden and the Forum only that statues of satyrs are consecrated,
as a protection against the evil effects<a id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> of spells and
sorcery; although in Plautus, we find the gardens spoken
of as being under the tutelage of Venus. At the present day,
under the general name of gardens,<a id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> we have pleasure-grounds
situate in the very heart of the City, as well as extensive fields
and villas.</p>

<p>Epicurus, that connoisseur<a id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> in the enjoyments of a life of
ease, was the first to lay out a garden at Athens;<a id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> up to his
time it had never been thought of, to dwell in the country in
the middle of the town. At Rome, on the other hand, the
garden<a id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> constituted of itself the poor man’s field, and it was
from the garden that the lower classes procured their daily
food—an aliment how guiltlessly obtained! But still, it is a
great deal better, no doubt,<a id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> to dive into the abysses of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
deep, and to seek each kind of oyster at the risk and peril of
shipwreck, to go searching for birds beyond the river Phasis<a id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a>
even, which, protected as they are by the terrors invented by
fable,<a id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> are only rendered all the more precious thereby—to go
searching for others, again, in Numidia,<a id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> and the very sepulchres
of &AElig;thiopia,<a id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> or else to be battling with wild beasts,
and to get eaten one’s self while trying to take a prey which
another person is to eat! And yet, by Hercules! how little do
the productions of the garden cost us in comparison with these!
How more than sufficient for every wish and for every want!—were
it not, indeed, that here, as in every thing else, turn which
way we will, we find the same grounds for our wrath and indignation.
We really might be content to allow of fruits being
grown of the most exquisite quality, remarkable, some of
them for their flavour, some for their size, some, again, for the
monstrosities of their growth, morsels all of them forbidden to
the poor!<a id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> We might allow of wines being kept till they are
mellowed with age, or enfeebled by being passed through<a id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a>
cloth strainers, of men, too, however prolonged their lives,
never drinking any but a wine that is still older than themselves!
We might allow of luxury devising how best to extract
the very aroma, as it were, and marrow<a id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> only from grain;
of people, too, living upon nothing but the choicest productions
of the confectioner, and upon pastes fashioned in fantastic
shapes: of one kind of bread being prepared for the rich, and
another for the multitude; of the yearly produce of the field
being classified in a descending scale, till it reaches the humble
means of the very lowest classes—but do we not find that
these refined distinctions have been extended to the very
herbs even, and that riches have contrived to establish points
of dissimilarity in articles of food which ordinarily sell for
a single copper coin?<a id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a></p>

<p>In this department even, humble as it is, we are still destined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
to find certain productions that are denied to the community
at large, and the very cabbages pampered to such an
enormous extent that the poor man’s table is not large enough
to hold them. Asparagus, by Nature, was intended to grow
wild,<a id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> so that each might gather it where he pleased—but,
lo and behold! we find it in the highest state of cultivation,
and Ravenna produces heads that weigh as much as three
pounds<a id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> even! Alas for the monstrous excess of gluttony!
It would be surprising indeed, for the beasts of the field to be
forbidden the thistle for food, and yet it is a thing forbidden<a id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a>
to the lower classes of the community! These refined distinctions,
too, are extended to the very water even, and, thanks
to the mighty influence of money, there are lines of demarcation
drawn in the very elements themselves. Some persons
are for drinking ice, others for quaffing snow, and thus is the
curse of the mountain steep turned into an appetizing stimulus
for the palate!<a id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> Cold is carefully treasured up for the
summer heats, and man’s invention is racked how best to keep
snow freezing in months that are not its own. Some again
there are who first boil the water,<a id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> and then bring it to the
temperature of winter—indeed, there is nothing that pleases
man in the fashion in which Nature originally made it.</p>

<p>And is it the fact, then, that any herb of the garden is
reared only for the rich man’s table? It is so—but still let
no one of the angered populace think of a fresh secession to
Mount Sacer or Mount Aventine; for to a certainty, in the long
run, all-powerful money will bring them back to just the
same position as they were in when it wrought the severance.
For, by Hercules!<a id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a> there was not an impost levied at Rome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
more grievous than the market-dues, an impost that aroused
the indignation of the populace, who repeatedly appealed with
loud clamours to all the chief men of the state to be relieved from
it. At last they were relieved from this heavy tax upon their
wares; and then it was found that there was no tax more
lucrative, more readily collected, or less obnoxious to the caprices
of chance, than the impost that was levied in exchange
for it, in the shape of a property-tax, extended to the poorest
classes: for now the very soil itself is their surety that paid
the tax will be, their means are patent to the light of day, and
the superficial extent of their possessions, whatever the weather
may chance to be, always remains the same.</p>

<p>Cato,<a id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> we find, speaks in high praise of garden cabbages:—indeed,
it was according to their respective methods of garden
cultivation that the agriculturists of early times were appreciated,
and it was immediately concluded that it was a sign of a
woman being a bad and careless manager of her family, when
the kitchen-garden—for this was looked upon as the woman’s
department more particularly—was negligently cultivated; as
in such case her only resource was, of course, the shambles or
the herb-market. But cabbages were not held in such high
esteem in those days as now: indeed, all dishes were held in
disrepute which required something else to help them down,
the great object being to economize oil as much as possible;
and as to the flesh-market, so much as a wish even to taste its
wares was visited with censure and reproach. The chief thing
that made them so fond of the garden was the fact that its
produce needs no fire and ensures economy in fuel, and that it
offers resources which are always ready and at hand. These
articles of food, which from their peculiar nature we call
“vinegar-diets,”<a id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> were found to be easy of digestion, by no
means apt to blunt and overload the senses, and to create but little
craving for bread as an accompaniment. A portion of them which
is still used by us for seasonings, attests that our forefathers used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
only to look at home for their resources, and that no Indian
peppers were in request with them, or any of those other condiments
which we are in the habit of seeking beyond the seas.
In former times the lower classes of Rome, with their mimic
gardens in their windows, day after day presented the reflex
of the country to the eye, when as yet the multitudes of atrocious
burglaries, almost innumerable, had not compelled us to
shut out all such sights with bars to the passers by.</p>

<p>Let the garden, then, have its due meed of honour, and let
not things, because they are common, enjoy for that the less
share of our consideration—and the more so, as we find that
from it men of the very highest rank have been content to
borrow their surnames even; thus in the Valerian family,
for instance, the Lactucini have not thought themselves
disgraced by taking their name from the lettuce. Perhaps,
too, our labours and research may contribute some slight recommendation
to this our subject; although, with Virgil,<a id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> we
are ready to admit how difficult it is, by language however
elevated, to ennoble a subject that is so humble in itself.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_20"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 20.—THE LAYING OUT OF GARDEN GROUND.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is no doubt that the proper plan is, to have the gardens
adjoining the country-house; and they should be watered,
more particularly, by a river running in front of it, if possible;
or else with water drawn from a well by the aid of a wheel
or of pumps, or by swipes.<a id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> The ground should be opened
just as the west winds are beginning to prevail; fourteen
days after which it should be got ready for autumn, and then
before the winter solstice it should have another turning up.
It will require eight men to dig a jugerum, manure being
mixed with the earth to a depth of three feet: the ground,
too, should be divided into plots or beds with raised and
rounded edges, each of which should have a path dug round it,
by means of which access may be afforded to the gardener and
a channel formed for the water needed for irrigation.</p>

<p>Among the garden plants there are some that recommend
themselves by their bulbs, others by the head, others by the
stalk, others by the leaf, others by both: some, again, are
valued for their seed, others for the outer coat, others for their

OF PLANTS WHICH GROW IN GARDENS—THE PROPER METHODS TO

<p>Of some plants the fruits<a id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> are in the earth, of others both in
the earth and out of it, and of others, again, out of the earth
solely. Some of them increase as they lie upon the ground,
gourds and cucumbers, for instance; the same products will
grow also in a hanging position, but they are much heavier
even then than any of the fruits that grow upon trees. The
cucumber, however, is composed of cartilage and a fleshy substance,
while the gourd consists of rind and cartilage: this last
is the only vegetable production the outer coat of which becomes
of a ligneous nature, when ripe. Radishes, turnips,
and rape are hidden in the earth, and so, too, are elecampane,<a id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a>
skirrets,<a id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> and parsnips,<a id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> though in a different manner. There
are some plants, again, to which we shall give the name of
“ferulaceous,” anise<a id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> and mallows, for instance; indeed, we
find it stated by some writers that in Arabia<a id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> the mallow becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
arborescent at the sixth month, so much so, in fact,
as to admit of its being used for walking-sticks. We have
another instance, again, in the mallow-tree of Mauretania,
which is found at Lixus, a city built upon an &aelig;stuary
there; and at which spot, it is said, were formerly the gardens
of the Hesperides, at a distance of two hundred paces from the
Ocean, near the shrine of Hercules, more ancient, tradition says,
than the temple at Gades. This mallow-tree<a id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> is twenty feet
in height, and of such a thickness that there is not a person in
existence who is able with his arms to span its girth.</p>

<p>In the class of ferulaceous plants we must include hemp<a id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a>
also. There are some plants, again, to which we must give
the appellation of “fleshy;”<a id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> such as those spongy<a id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> productions
which are found growing in damp meadows. As to the fungus,
with a hard, tough flesh, we have already<a id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> made mention of
it when speaking of wood and trees; and of truffles, which
form another variety, we have but very recently given a description.<a id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_23"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 23. (5.)—VEGETABLES OF A CARTILAGINOUS NATURE—CUCUMBERS.
PEPONES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The cucumber<a id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> belongs to the cartilaginous class of plants,
and grows above the ground. It was a wonderful favourite
with the Emperor Tiberius, and, indeed, he was never without
it; for he had raised beds made in frames upon wheels,
by means of which the cucumbers were moved and exposed to
the full heat of the sun; while, in winter, they were withdrawn,
and placed under the protection of frames glazed with mirror-stone.<a id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a>
We find it stated, also, by the ancient Greek writers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
that the cucumber ought to be propagated from seed that has
been steeped<a id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> a couple of days in milk and honey, this method
having the effect of rendering them all the sweeter to the taste.
The cucumber, while growing, may be trained to take any form
that may be wished: in Italy the cucumbers are green<a id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> and
very small, while those grown in some of the provinces are
remarkably large, and of a wax colour or black.<a id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> Those of
Africa, which are also remarkably prolific, are held in high
esteem; the same, too, with the cucumbers of Mœsia, which
are by far the largest of all. When the cucumber acquires a
very considerable volume, it is known to us as the “pepo.”<a id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a>
Cucumbers when eaten remain on the stomach till the following
day, and are very difficult<a id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> of digestion; still, for all that,
in general they are not considered very unwholesome. By
nature they have a wonderful hatred to oil, and no less affection
for water, and this after they have been cut from the stem
even.<a id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> If water is within a moderate distance of them, they
will creep towards it, while from oil, on the other hand, they
will shrink away; if any obstacle, too, should happen to arrest
their progress, or if they are left to hang, they will grow
curved and crooked. Of these facts we may be satisfactorily
convinced in a single night even, for if a vessel filled with
water is placed at four fingers’ distance from a cucumber, it
will be found to have descended to it by the following morning;
but if the same is done with oil, it will have assumed the
curved form of a hook by the next day. If hung in a tube
while in blossom, the cucumber will grow to a most surprising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
length.<a id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> It is only of late, too, that a cucumber of entirely
new shape has been produced in Campania, it having just the
form of a quince.<a id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> It was quite by accident, I am told, that
the first one acquired this shape in growing, and it was from
the seed of this that all the others have been reproduced.
The name given to this variety is “melopepo.” These last do
not grow hanging, but assume their round shape as they lie
on the ground. A thing that is very remarkable in them, in
addition to their shape, colour, and smell, is the fact that,
when ripe, although they do not hang from the stem, they
separate from it at the stalk.</p>

<p>Columella<a id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> has given us a plan of his, by which we may
have cucumbers the whole year round: the largest bramble-bush
that can be procured is transplanted to a warm, sunny
spot, and then cut down, about the time of the vernal equinox,
to within a couple of fingers of the ground; a cucumber-seed
is then inserted in the pith of the bramble, and the roots are
well moulded up with fine earth and manure, to withstand the
cold. According to the Greeks, there are three kinds of cucumbers,
the Laconian, the Scytalic, and the Bœotian,<a id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> the
Laconian being the only one among them that is fond<a id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> of the
water.</p>

<p>There are some persons who recommend steeping the seed of
the cucumber in the juice of the herb known as the “culix;”<a id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a>
the produce, they say, will be sure to grow without seeds.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_24"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 24.—GOURDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Gourds resemble the cucumber in nature, at least in their
manner of growing; they manifest an equal aversion to the
winter, too, while they require constant watering and manure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Both cucumbers and gourds are sown in holes a foot and
a half<a id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> deep, between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice,
at the time of the Parilia<a id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> more particularly. Some persons,
however, think it better to sow gourds after the calends
of March,<a id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> and cucumbers after the nones,<a id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> and at the time of
the Quinquatria.<a id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> The cucumber and the gourd climb upwards
in a precisely similar manner, their shoots creeping along
the rough surface of the walls, even to the very roof, so great
is their fondness for elevated spots. They have not sufficient
strength, however, to support themselves without the aid of
stays. Shooting upwards with the greatest rapidity, they soon
cover with their light shade the arched roofs of the houses and
the trellises on which they are trained. From this circumstance
it is that we find the gourd classified into two primary
kinds, the roof-gourd,<a id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> and the common gourd, which creeps
upon the ground. In the first kind, from a stalk of remarkable
thinness is suspended a fruit of considerable weight and
volume, and quite immoveable by the action of the wind. The
gourd, too, as well as the cucumber, admits of being lengthened
to any extent, by the aid of osier tubes more particularly. Just
after the blossom has fallen off, the plant is introduced into
these tubes, and as it grows it can be made to assume any form
that may be wished, that of a serpent coiled up being the one
that is mostly preferred; if left at liberty to grow as it hangs,
it has been known before now to attain to no less than<a id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> nine
feet in length.</p>

<p>The cucumber flowers gradually, blossom succeeding blossom;
and it adapts itself perfectly well to a dry soil. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
covered with a white down, which increases in quantity as the
plant gains in size.</p>

<p>The gourd admits of being applied to more numerous uses
than the cucumber even: the stem is used as an article of
food<a id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> when young, but at a later period it changes its nature,
and its qualities become totally different: of late, gourds have
come to be used in baths for jugs and pitchers, but for this
long time past they have been employed as casks<a id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> for keeping
wine. The rind is tender while the fruit is green, but still it
is always scraped off when the gourd is used for food. It admits
of being eaten several ways, and forms a light and wholesome
aliment, and this although it is one of those fruits that
are difficult of digestion by the human stomach, and are apt to
swell out those who eat of them. The seeds which lie nearest
to the neck of the gourd produce fruit of remarkable<a id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> length,
and so do those which lie at the lower extremities, though not
at all comparable with the others. Those, on the other hand,
which lie in the middle, produce gourds of a round shape, and
those on the sides fruit that are thick and short. The seeds
are dried by being placed in the shade, and when wanted for
sowing, are steeped in water first. The longer and thinner the
gourd is, the more agreeable it is to the palate, and hence it is
that those which have been left to grow hanging are reckoned
the most wholesome: these, too, have fewer seeds than the
others, the hardness of which is apt to render the fruit less
agreeable for eating.</p>

<p>Those which are intended for keeping seed, are usually not cut
before the winter sets in; they are then dried in the smoke,
and are extensively employed for preserving<a id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> garden seeds, and
for making other articles for domestic use. There has been a
method discovered, also, of preserving the gourd for table, and
the cucumber as well, till nearly the time when the next year’s
crop is ripe; this is done by putting them in brine. We are
assured, too, that if put in a hole dug in a place well shaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
from the sun, with a layer of sand beneath, and dry hay and
earth on the top of them, they may be kept green for a very
long time. We also find wild<a id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> cucumbers and gourds; and,
indeed, the same is the case with pretty nearly all the garden
plants. These wild varieties, however, are only possessed of
certain medicinal properties, and for this reason we shall defer
any further mention of them till we come to the Books appropriated
to that subject.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_25"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 25.—RAPE. TURNIPS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The other plants that are of a cartilaginous nature are concealed,
all of them, in the earth. In the number of these is
the rape, a subject upon which it would almost appear that
we have treated<a id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> at sufficient length already, were it not that
we think it as well to observe, that medical men call those
which are round “male,”<a id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> while those which are larger and
more elongated, are known to them as “female” rape: these
last are superior in sweetness, and better for keeping, but by
successive sowings they are changed into male rape.<a id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a></p>

<p>The same authors, too, have distinguished five different varieties
of the turnip:<a id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> the Corinthian, the Cleon&aelig;an, the
Liothasian, the Bœotian, and the one which they have characterized
as peculiarly the “green,” turnip. The Corinthian
turnip<a id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> grows to a very large size, and the root is all but out
of the ground; indeed, this is the only kind that, in growing,
shoots upwards, and not as the others do, downwards into the
ground. The Liothasian is known by some persons as the
Thracian turnip;<a id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> it is the one that stands extreme cold the
best of all. Next to it, the Bœotian kind is the sweetest; it is remarkable,
also, for the roundness of its shape and its shortness;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
while the Cleon&aelig;an turnip,<a id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> on the other hand, is of an elongated
form. Those, in general, which have a thin, smooth leaf,
are the sweetest; while those, again, the leaf of which is rough,
angular, and prickly, have a pungent taste. There is a kind
of wild turnip,<a id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> also, the leaves of which resemble those of
rocket.<a id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> At Rome, the highest rank is given to the turnips
of Amiternum,<a id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> and those of Nursia; after them, those grown
in the neighbourhood of the City<a id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> are held in the next degree
of esteem. The other particulars connected with the
sowing of the turnip have been already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> by us when
speaking of the rape.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_26"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 26.—RADISHES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Radishes are composed of an outer coat and a cartilaginous
substance, and in many instances the rind is found to be thicker
than the bark of some trees. This plant is remarkable for its
pungency, which increases in proportion to the thickness of the
rind: in some cases, too, the surface of it assumes a ligneous
nature. Radishes are flatulent<a id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> to a remarkable degree, and
are productive of eructations; hence it is that they are looked
upon as an aliment only fit for low-bred people,<a id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> and this
more particularly if coleworts are eaten directly after them.
If, on the other hand, they are eaten with green olives, the
eructations produced are not so frequent, and less offensive.
In Egypt the radish is held in very high esteem, on account
of the abundance of oil<a id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> that is extracted from the seed. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the people of that country sow this plant in preference
to any other, whenever they can get the opportunity, the profits
derived from it being larger than those obtained from the cultivation
of corn, and the imposts levied upon it considerably less:
there is no grain known that yields a larger quantity of oil.</p>

<p>The Greeks have distinguished the radish<a id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> into three different
kinds, according to the characteristic features of the
leaves, there being the crisped leaf, the smooth leaf, and the
wild radish, the leaf of which is smooth, but shorter than that
of the others; it is round also, grows in great abundance, and
spreads like a shrub. The taste of this last variety is acrid,
and it acts medicinally as a strong purgative. In the first kind,
again, there are certain differences, determined by the seed, for
in some varieties the seed is of an inferior quality, and in others
remarkably small: these defects, however, are only found to
exist in the kind that has the crisped leaf.</p>

<p>Our own people, again, have found other varieties of the
radish: there is the Algidan<a id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> radish, long and transparent, so
called from the place of its growth: another, similar to the
rape in form, is known as the Syrian radish; it is pretty
nearly the mildest and the most tender of them all, and is well
able to bear the winter. The very best of all, however, is the
one that has been brought from Syria, very recently it would
seem, as we do not find it mentioned by any of our writers:
it lasts the whole of the winter through. In addition to these
kinds, there is another, a wild variety, known by the Greeks as
“agrion,”<a id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> and to the people of Pontus as “armon,” while
others, again, call it “leuce,”<a id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> and our people “armoracia;”<a id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a>
it has more leaves, however, than root.</p>

<p>In testing the quality of the radish, it is the stem more particularly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
that is looked at; in those which are acrid to the
taste, for instance, it is rounder and thicker than in the others,
and grooved with long channels, while the leaves are more unsightly
to the eye, being angular and covered with prickles.</p>

<p>The radish requires to be sown in a loose, humid soil, has a
great aversion to manure, and is content with a dressing solely
of chaff: so fond is it of the cold, that in Germany it is known
to grow as large as an infant in size.<a id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> For the spring crop,
it is sown immediately after the ides of February;<a id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> and then
again about the time of the Vulcanalia,<a id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> this last crop being
looked upon as the best: many persons, however, sow radishes
in March, April, and September. When the plant begins to
grow to any size, it is considered a good plan to cover up the
leaves successively, and to earth up the root as well; for the
part of it which appears above ground is apt to become hard
and pithy. Aristomachus recommends the leaves to be taken
off in winter, and the roots to be well moulded up, to prevent
the water from accumulating about them; and he says, that
by using these precautions, they will be all the finer in summer.
Some authors have mentioned a plan of making a hole with a
dibble, and covering it at the bottom with a layer of chaff, six
fingers in depth; upon this layer the seed is put, and then
covered over with manure and earth; the result of which is,
according to their statement, that radishes are obtained full as
large as the hole so made. It is salt, however, that conduces
more particularly to their nutriment, and hence it is that they are
often watered with brine; in Egypt, too, the growers sprinkle
nitre<a id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> over them, the roots being remarkable for their mildness.
The salt, too, has the similar effect of removing all their pungency,
and when thus treated, they become very similar in
their qualities to radishes that have been boiled: for when
boiled they become sweet and mild, and eat, in fact, just like
turnips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>Medical men recommend raw radishes to be eaten fasting,
with salt, for the purpose<a id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> of collecting the crude humours of
the viscera; and in this way they prepare them for the action
of emetics. It is said, too, that the juices of this plant are
absolutely necessary for the cure of certain diseases of the
diaphragm; for it has been found by experiment, in Egypt,
that the phthiriasis<a id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> which attaches itself to the internal parts
of the heart, cannot possibly be eradicated by any other remedy,
the kings of that country having ordered the bodies of the
dead to be opened and examined, for the purpose of enquiring
into certain diseases.</p>

<p>Such, too, is the frivolity of the Greeks, that, in the temple
of Apollo at Delphi, it is said, the radish is so greatly preferred
to all other articles of diet, as to be represented there in
gold, the beet in silver, and the rape in lead.—You might be
very sure that Manius Curius was not a native of that country,
the general whom, as we find stated in our Annals, the ambassadors
of the Samnites found busy roasting rape at the fire,
when they came to offer him the gold which he so indignantly
refused. Moschion, too, a Greek author, has written a volume
on the subject of the radish. These vegetables are considered
a very useful article of food during the winter, but they are at
all times very injurious to the teeth, as they are apt to wear
them away; at all events, they give a polish to ivory. There
is a great antipathy between the radish<a id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> and the vine; which
last will shrink from the radish, if sown in its vicinity.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_27"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 27.—PARSNIPS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The other kinds which have been classified by us among the
cartilaginous plants, are of a more ligneous nature; and it is
a singular thing, that they have, all of them, a strong flavour.
Among these, there is one kind of wild parsnip which grows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
spontaneously; by the Greeks it is known as “staphylinos.”<a id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a>
Another kind<a id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> of parsnip is grown either from the root transplanted,
or else from seed, at the beginning of spring or in the
autumn; Hyginus says that this may be done in February,
August, September, and October, the ground being dug to a
very considerable depth for the purpose. The parsnip begins
to be fit for eating at the end of a year, but it is still better at
the end of two: it is reckoned more agreeable eating in autumn,
and more particularly if cooked in the saucepan; even then,
however, it preserves its strong pungent flavour, which it is
found quite impossible to get rid of.</p>

<p>The hibiscum<a id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> differs from the parsnip in being more slender:
it is rejected as a food, but is found useful for its medicinal
properties. There is a fourth kind,<a id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> also, which bears a similar
degree of resemblance to the parsnip; by our people it is
called the “gallica,” while the Greeks, who have distinguished
four varieties of it, give it the name of “daucus.” We shall
have further occasion<a id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> to mention it among the medicinal
plants.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_28"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 28.—THE SKIRRET.</span></h3></div>

<p>The skirret,<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> too, has had its reputation established by the
Emperor Tiberius, who demanded a supply of it every year
from Germany. It is at Gelduba,<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> a fortress situate on the
banks of the Rhenus, that the finest are grown; from which
it would appear that they thrive best in a cold climate.
There is a string running through the whole length of the
skirret, and which is drawn out after it is boiled; but still,
for all this, a considerable proportion of its natural pungency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
is retained; indeed, when modified by the addition of honied
wine, this is even thought to impart to dishes an additional
relish. The larger parsnip has also a similar sting inside, but
only when it is a year old. The proper time for sowing the
skirret is in the months of February, March, April, August,
September, and October.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_29"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 29.—ELECAMPANE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Elecampane<a id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> is not so elongated as the preceding roots, but
more substantial and more pungent; eaten by itself it is very
injurious to the stomach, but when mixed with other condiments
of a sweet nature, it is extremely wholesome. There
are several methods employed for modifying<a id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> its natural
acridity and rendering it agreeable to the palate: thus, for instance,
when dried it is reduced to a fine flour, and then mixed
with some sweet liquid or other, or else it is boiled in vinegar
and water, or kept in soak in it; it is also steeped in various
other ways, and then mixed with boiled<a id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> grape-juice, or else
incorporated with honey or raisins, or dates with plenty of
meat on them. Other persons, again, have a method of preparing
it with quinces, or else sorbs or plums, while sometimes
the flavour is varied by the addition of pepper or thyme.</p>

<p>This plant is particularly good for weakness of the stomach,
and it has acquired a high reputation from the circumstance
that Julia<a id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> Augusta used to eat it daily. The seed of it is
quite useless, as the plant is reproduced, like the reed, from
eyes extracted from the root. This vegetable, as well as the
skirret and the parsnip, is sown both in spring and autumn, a
considerable distance being left between the plants; indeed, for
elecampane, a space of no less than three feet is required, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
it throws out its shoots to a very considerable distance.<a id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a>
Skirrets, however, are best transplanted.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_30"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 30.—BULBS, SQUILLS, AND ARUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Next in affinity to these plants are the bulbs,<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> which Cato,
speaking in high terms of those of Megara,<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> recommends most
particularly for cultivation. Among these bulbs, the squill,<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a>
we find, occupies the very highest rank, although by nature it
is medicinal, and is employed for imparting an additional sharpness
to vinegar:<a id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> indeed, there is no bulb known that grows
to a larger size than this, or is possessed of a greater degree of
pungency. There are two varieties of it employed in medicine,
the male squill, which has white leaves, and the female
squill, with black<a id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> ones. There is a third kind also, which is
good to eat, and is known as the Epimenidian<a id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> squill; the leaf
is narrower than in the other kinds, and not so rough. All
the squills have numerous seeds, but they come up much more
quickly if propagated from the offsets that grow on the sides.
To make them attain a still greater size, the large leaves that
grow around them are turned down and covered over with
earth; by which method all the juices are carried to the
heads. Squills grow spontaneously and in vast numbers in
the Baleares and the island of Ebusus, and in the Spanish provinces.<a id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>
The philosopher Pythagoras has written a whole volume
on the merits of this plant, setting forth its various medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
properties; of which we shall have occasion to speak
more at length in the succeeding Book.<a id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a></p>

<p>The other species of bulbs are distinguished by their colour,
size, and sweetness; indeed, there are some that are eaten raw
even—those found in the Tauric Chersonesus, for instance.
Next to these, the bulbs of Africa are held in the highest
esteem, and after them those of Apulia. The Greeks have
distinguished the following varieties: the bulbine,<a id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> the setanion,<a id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a>
the opition,<a id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> the cyix,<a id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> the leucoion,<a id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> the &aelig;gilips,<a id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> and
the sisyrinchion<a id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a>—in the last there is this remarkable feature,
that the extremities of the roots increase in winter, but during
the spring, when the violet appears, they diminish in size and
gradually contract, and then it is that the bulb begins to increase
in magnitude.</p>

<p>Among the varieties of the bulb, too, there is the plant
known in Egypt by the name of “aron.”<a id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> In size it is very
nearly as large as the squill, with a leaf like that of lapathum,
and a straight stalk a couple of cubits in length, and the thickness
of a walking-stick: the root of it is of a milder nature,
so much so, indeed, as to admit of being eaten raw.</p>

<p>Bulbs are taken up before the spring, for if not, they are
apt to spoil very quickly. It is a sign that they are ripe when
the leaves become dry at the lower extremities. When too
old they are held in disesteem; the same, too, with the long
and the smaller ones; those, on the other hand, which are red
and round are greatly preferred, as also those of the largest
size. In most of them there is a certain degree of pungency
in the upper part, but the middle is sweet. The ancients have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
stated that bulbs are reproduced from seed only, but in the
champaign country of Pr&aelig;neste they grow spontaneously,
and they grow to an unlimited extent in the territory of the
Remi.<a id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a></p>

<p>Nearly all<a id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> the garden plants have a single<a id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> root only,
radishes, beet, parsley, and mallows, for example; it is lapathum,
however, that has the longest root of them all, it attaining
the length of three cubits even. The root of the wild
kind is smaller and of a humid nature, and when up it will
keep alive for a considerable period. In some of these plants,
however, the roots are fibrous, as we find the case in parsley
and mallows, for instance; in others, again, they are of a
ligneous nature, as in ocimum, for example; and in others they
are fleshy, as in beet, and in saffron even more so. In some,
again, the root is composed of rind and flesh, as in the radish
and the rape; while in others it is jointed, as in hay grass.<a id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a>
Those plants which have not a straight root throw out immediately
a great number of hairy fibres, orage<a id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> and blite,<a id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> for
instance: squills again, bulbs, onions, and garlic never have
any but a vertical root. Among the plants that grow spontaneously,
there are some which have more numerous roots
than leaves, spalax,<a id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> for example, pellitory,<a id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> and saffron.<a id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_32"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 32.—VARIETIES OF THE ONION.</span></h3></div>

<p>Garlic and onions<a id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> are invoked by the Egyptians,<a id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> when
taking an oath, in the number of their deities. The Greeks
have many varieties<a id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> of the onion, the Sardian onion, the
Samothracian, the Alsidenian, the setanian, the schistan, and
the Ascalonian,<a id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> so called from Ascalon,<a id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> a city of Jud&aelig;a.
They have, all of them, a pungent smell, which<a id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> draws tears
from the eyes, those of Cyprus more particularly, and those of
Cnidos the least of all. In all of them the body is composed
of a cartilage of an unctuous<a id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> nature. The variety known as
the setanian is the smallest of them all, with the exception of
the Tusculan<a id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> onion, but it is sweet to the taste. The schistan<a id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a>
and the Ascalonian kinds are used for storing. The
schistan onion is left during the winter with the leaves on; in
the spring it is stripped of them, upon which offsets make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
their appearance at the same divisions as the leaves; it is to
this circumstance that this variety owes its name. Taking
the hint from this fact, it is recommended to strip the other
kinds of their leaves, to make them bulb all the better, instead
of running to seed.</p>

<p>The Ascalonian onion is of a peculiar nature, being barren
in some measure in the root; hence it is that the Greeks have
recommended it to be reproduced from seed, and not from roots:
the transplanting, too, they say, should be done later in the
spring, at the time the plant germinates, the result being that
it bulbs with all the greater rapidity, and hastens, as it were,
to make up for lost time; great dispatch, however, is requisite
in taking it up, for when ripe it rots with the greatest rapidity.
If propagated from roots, it throws out a long stalk,
runs rapidly to seed, and dies.</p>

<p>There are considerable differences, too, in the colour of the
onion; the whitest of all are those grown at Issus and Sardes.
The onions, too, of Crete are held in high esteem, but there
is some doubt whether they are not the same as the Ascalonian
variety; for when grown from seed they produce a fine bulb,
but when planted they throw out a long stalk and run to seed;
in fact, they differ from the Ascalonian kind only in the sweetness
of their flavour.</p>

<p>Among us there are two principal varieties known of the
onion; the scallion, employed for seasonings, is one, known to
the Greeks by the name of “gethyon,” and by us as the “pallacana;”
it is sown in March, April, and May. The other
kind is the bulbed or headed<a id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> onion; it is sown just after the
autumnal equinox, or else after the west winds have begun to
prevail. The varieties of this last kind, ranged according to
their relative degrees of pungency, are the African onion, the
Gallic, the Tusculan, the Ascalonian, and the Amiternian: the
roundest in shape are the best. The red onion, too, is more
pungent than the white, the stored than the fresh, the raw
than the cooked, and the dried than the preserved. The onion
of Amiternum is cultivated in cold, humid localities, and is
the only one that is reproduced from heads,<a id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> like garlic, the
other kinds being grown from seed. This last kind yields no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
seed in the ensuing summer, but a bulb only, which dries and
keeps; but in the summer after, the contrary is the case, for
seed is produced, while the bulb very quickly spoils. Hence
it is that every year there are two separate sowings, one of
seed for the reproduction of bulbs, and one of bulbs for the
growth of seed; these onions keep best in chaff. The scallion
has hardly any bulb at all, but a long neck only—hence it is
nothing but leaf, and is often cut down, like the leek; for this
reason, too, like the leek, it is grown from seed, and not from
plants.</p>

<p>In addition to these particulars, it is recommended that the
ground intended for sowing onions should be turned up three
times, care being taken to remove all roots and weeds; ten
pounds of seed is the proper proportion for a jugerum. Savory
too, they say, should be mixed with them, the onions being all
the finer for it; the ground, too, should be stubbed and hoed
four times at least, if not oftener. In Italy, the Ascalonian
onion is sown in the month of February. The seed of the
onion is gathered when it begins to turn black, and before it
becomes dry and shrivelled.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_33"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 33.—THE LEEK.</span></h3></div>

<p>While upon this subject, it will be as well, too, to speak of
the leek,<a id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> on account of the affinity which it bears to the plants
just mentioned, and more particularly because cut-leek has
recently acquired considerable celebrity from the use made of
it by the Emperor Nero. That prince, to improve his voice,<a id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>
used to eat leeks and oil every month, upon stated days, abstaining
from every other kind of food, and not touching so
much as a morsel of bread even. Leeks are reproduced from
seed, sown just after the autumnal equinox; if they are intended
for cutting,<a id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> the seed is sown thicker than otherwise.
The leeks in the same bed are cut repeatedly, till it is quite exhausted,
and they are always kept well manured. If they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
wanted to bulb before being cut, when they have grown to
some size they are transplanted to another bed, the extremities
of the leaves being snipped off without touching the white part,
and the heads stripped of the outer coats. The ancients were
in the habit of placing a stone or potsherd upon the leek, to
make the head grow all the larger, and the same with the
bulbs as well; but at the present day it is the usual practice
to move the fibrous roots gently with the weeding-hook, so that
by being bent they may nourish the plant, and not withdraw
the juices from it.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that, though the leek stands in need
of manure and a rich soil, it has a particular aversion to water;
and yet its nature depends very much upon the natural properties
of the soil. The most esteemed leeks are those grown in
Egypt, and next to them those of Ostia and Aricia.<a id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> Of the
leek for cutting, there are two varieties: that with grass-green<a id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a>
leaves and incisions distinctly traced on them, and the
leek with paler and rounder leaves, the incisions being more
lightly marked. There is a story told, that Mela,<a id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> a member
of the Equestrian order, being accused of mal-administration
by order of the Emperor Tiberius, swallowed in his despair
leek-juice to the amount of three denarii in weight of silver,
and expired upon the spot without the slightest symptom of
pain. It is said, however, that a larger dose than this is productive
of no injurious effects whatever.<a id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 34.—GARLIC.</span></h3></div>

<p>Garlic<a id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> is generally supposed, in the country more particularly,
to be a good specific<a id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> for numerous maladies. The external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
coat consists of membranes of remarkable fineness, which
are universally discarded when the vegetable is used; the inner
part being formed by the union of several cloves, each of which
has also a separate coat of its own. The flavour of it is pungent,
and the more numerous the cloves the more pungent it
is. Like the onion, it imparts an offensive smell to the breath;
but this is not the case when it is cooked. The various species
of garlic are distinguished by the periods at which they ripen:
the early kind becomes fit for use in sixty days. Another distinction,
too, is formed by the relative size of the heads. Ulpicum,<a id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a>
also, generally known to the Greeks as “Cyprian garlic,”
belongs to this class; by some persons it is called “antiscorodon,”
and in Africa more particularly it holds a high rank
among the dishes of the rural population; it is of a larger size
than ordinary garlic. When beaten up with oil and vinegar,
it is quite surprising what a quantity of creaming foam is produced.</p>

<p>There are some persons who recommend that neither ulpicum
nor garlic should be sown on level ground, but say that they
should be planted in little mounds trenched up, at a distance of
three feet apart. Between each clove, they say, there should
be a distance of four fingers left, and as soon as ever three
leaves are visible, the heads should be hoed; the oftener they
are hoed, the larger the size they will attain. When they
begin to ripen, the stalks are bent downwards, and covered
over with earth, a precaution which effectually prevents them
from running to leaf. In cold soils, it is considered better to
plant them in spring than in autumn.</p>

<p>For the purpose of depriving all these plants of their strong
smell, it is recommended to set them when the moon is below
the horizon, and to take them up when she is in conjunction.
Independently of these precautions, we find Menander, one
of the Greek writers, recommending those who have been
eating garlic to eat immediately afterwards a root of beet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
roasted on hot coals; if this is done, he says, the strong smell
of the garlic will be effectually neutralized. Some persons are of
opinion, that the proper period for planting garlic and ulpicum
is between the festival of the Compitalia<a id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> and that of the
Saturnalia.<a id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> Garlic, too, can be grown from seed, but it is
very slow, in such case, in coming to maturity; for in the first
year, the head attains the size only of that of a leek, in the
second, it separates into cloves, and only in the third it arrives
at maturity; there are some, however, who think that garlic
grown this way is the best. Garlic should never be allowed
to run to seed, but the stalk should be twisted, to promote its
growth, and to make the head attain a larger size.</p>

<p>If garlic or onions are wanted to keep some time, the heads
should be dipped in salt water, made luke-warm; by doing
this, they will be all the better for keeping, though quite
worthless for reproduction. Some persons content themselves
with hanging them over burning coals, and are of opinion that
this is quite sufficient to prevent them from sprouting: for it
is a well-known fact, that both garlic and onions sprout when
out of the ground, and that after throwing out their thin shoots
they shrivel away to nothing. Some persons are of opinion,
too, that the best way of keeping garlic is by storing it in chaff.
There is a kind<a id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> of garlic that grows spontaneously in the
fields, and is known by the name of “alum.” To preserve
the seeds that are sown there from the remorseless ravages of
the birds, this plant is scattered over the ground, being first
boiled, to prevent it from shooting. As soon as ever they have
eaten of it, the birds become so stupefied as to be taken with
the hand even,<a id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> and if they remain but a few moments only
on the spot, they fall fast asleep. There is a wild garlic,
too, generally known as “bear’s” garlic;<a id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> it has exactly the
smell of millet, with a very small head and large leaves.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_35"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 35. (7.)—THE NUMBER OF DAYS REQUIRED FOR THE RESPECTIVE
PLANTS TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE ABOVE GROUND.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the garden<a id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> plants which make their appearance
most speedily above ground, are ocimum, blite, the turnip, and
rocket; for they appear above the surface the third day after
they are sown. Anise, again, comes up on the fourth day, the
lettuce on the fifth, the radish on the sixth, the cucumber and
the gourd on the seventh—the cucumber rather the first of the
two—cresses and mustard on the fifth, beet on the sixth day
in summer and the tenth in winter, orage on the eighth, onions
on the nineteenth or twentieth, and scallions on the tenth
or twelfth. Coriander, again, is more stubborn in its growth,
cunila and wild marjoram do not appear till after the thirtieth
day, and parsley comes up with the greatest difficulty of all,
for at the very earliest it is forty days before it shows itself,
and in most instances as much as fifty.</p>

<p>The age,<a id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> too, of the seed is of some importance in this respect;
for fresh seed comes up more rapidly in the case of the
leek, the scallion, the cucumber, and the gourd, while in that
of parsley, beet, cardamum, cunila, wild marjoram, and coriander,
seed that has been kept for some time is the best.</p>

<p>There is one remarkable circumstance<a id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> in connection with
the seed of beet; it does not all germinate in the first year, but
some of it in the second, and some in the third even; hence
it is that a considerable quantity of seed produces only a very
moderate crop. Some plants produce only in the year in which
they are set, and some, again, for successive years, parsley,
leeks, and scallions<a id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> for instance; indeed, these plants, when
once sown, retain their fertility, and produce for many years.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_36"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 36.—THE NATURE OF THE VARIOUS SEEDS.
</span></h3></div>

<p>In most plants the seed is round, in some oblong; it is broad
and foliaceous in some, orage for instance, while in others it is
narrow and grooved, as in cummin. There are differences,
also, in the colour of seeds, which is either black or white;
while some seeds are woody and hard, in radishes, mustard,
and rape, the seeds are enclosed in pods. In parsley, coriander,
anise, fennel, and cummin, the seed has no covering at all,
while in blite, beet, orage, and ocimum, it has an outer coat,
and in the lettuce it is covered with a fine down. There is no
seed more prolific than that of ocimum;<a id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> it is generally recommended<a id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a>
to sow it with the utterance of curses and imprecations,
the result being that it grows all the better for it;
the earth, too, is rammed down when it is sown, and prayers
offered that the seed may never come up. The seeds which are
enveloped in an outer coat, are dried with considerable difficulty,
that of ocimum more particularly; hence it is that all
these seeds are dried artificially, their fruitfulness being greatly
promoted thereby.</p>

<p>Plants in general come up better when the seed is sown in
heaps than when it is scattered broad-cast: leeks, in fact, and
parsley are generally grown by sowing the seed in little bags;<a id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a>
in the case of parsley, too, a hole is made with the dibble, and a
layer of manure inserted.</p>

<p>All garden plants grow either from seed or from slips, and
some from both seed and suckers, such as rue, wild marjoram,
and ocimum,<a id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> for example—this last being usually cut when
it is a palm in height. Some kinds, again, are reproduced
from both seed and root, as in the case of onions, garlic, and
bulbs, and those other plants of which, though annuals themselves,
the roots retain their vitality. In those plants which
grow from the root, it lives for a considerable time, and throws
out offsets, as in bulbs, scallions, and squills for example.—Others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
again, throw out offsets, though not from a bulbous
root, such as parsley and beet, for instance. When the stalk
is cut, with the exception<a id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> of those which have not a rough
stem, nearly all these plants put forth fresh shoots, a thing that
may be seen in ocimum,<a id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> the radish,<a id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> and the lettuce,<a id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> which
are in daily use among us; indeed, it is generally thought that
the lettuce which is grown from a fresh sprouting, is the
sweetest. The radish, too, is more pleasant eating when the
leaves have been removed before it has begun to run to stalk.
The same is the case, too, with rape; for when the leaves are
taken off, and the roots well covered up with earth, it grows
all the larger for it, and keeps in good preservation till the ensuing
summer.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 37.—PLANTS OF WHICH THERE IS BUT A SINGLE KIND.
PLANTS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of ocimum, lapathum, blite, cresses, rocket, orage, coriander,
and anise respectively, there is but a single kind, these plants
being the same everywhere, and no better in one place than
in another. It is the general belief that stolen<a id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> rue grows
the best, while, on the other hand, bees<a id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> that have been stolen
will never thrive. Wild mint, cat-mint, endive, and pennyroyal,
will grow even without any cultivation. With reference
to the plants of which we have already spoken, or shall
have occasion to speak, there are numerous varieties of many
of them, parsley more particularly.</p>

<p>(8.) As to the kind of parsley<a id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> which grows spontaneously
in moist localities, it is known by the name of “helioselinum;”<a id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a>
it has a single leaf<a id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> only, and is not rough at the edges. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
dry places, we find growing the kind known as “hipposelinum,”<a id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a>
consisting of numerous leaves, similar to helioselinum.
A third variety is the oreoselinum,<a id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> with leaves like those of
hemlock, and a thin, fine, root, the seed being similar to that
of anise, only somewhat smaller.</p>

<p>The differences, again, that are found to exist in cultivated
parsley,<a id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> consist in the comparative density of the leaves, the
crispness or smoothness of their edges, and the thinness or
thickness of the stem, as the case may be: in some kinds, again,
the stem is white, in others purple, and in others mottled.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_38"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 38.—THE NATURE AND VARIETIES OF TWENTY-THREE
GARDEN PLANTS. THE LETTUCE; ITS DIFFERENT VARIETIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Greeks have distinguished three varieties of the lettuce;<a id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>
the first with a stalk so large, that small garden gates,<a id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> it is
said, have been made of it: the leaf of this lettuce is somewhat
larger than that of the herbaceous, or green lettuce, but
extremely narrow, the nutriment seeming to be expended on
the other parts of the plant. The second kind is that with a
rounded<a id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> stalk; and the third is the low, squat lettuce,<a id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> generally
known as the Laconian lettuce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Some persons<a id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> have made distinctions in reference to their
respective colours, and the times for sowing them: the black
lettuce is sown in the month of January, the white in March,
and the red in April; and they are fit for transplanting, all of
them, at the end of a couple of months. Those, again, who
have pursued these enquiries even further than this, have distinguished
a still greater number of varieties of them—the
purple, the crisped, the Cappadocian,<a id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> and the Greek lettuce,
this last having a longer leaf than the rest, and a broad stalk:
in addition to which, there is one with a long, narrow leaf,
very similar to endive in appearance. The most inferior kind,
however, of all, is the one to which the Greeks, censuring it
for its bitterness, have given the name of “picris.”<a id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> There is
still another variety, a kind of white lettuce, called “meconis,”<a id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a>
a name which it derives from the abundance of milk, of a
narcotic quality, which it produces; though, in fact, it is generally
thought that they are all of them of a soporific tendency.
In former times, this last was the only kind of lettuce that
was held in any esteem<a id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> in Italy, the name “lactuca” having
been given it on account of the milk<a id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> which it contains.</p>

<p>The purple kind, with a very large root, is generally known
as the C&aelig;cilian<a id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> lettuce; while the round one, with an extremely
diminutive root and broad leaves, is known to some
persons as the “astytis,”<a id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> and to others as the “eunychion,”
it having the effect, in a remarkable degree, of quenching the
amorous propensities. Indeed, they are, all of them, possessed
of cooling and refreshing properties, for which reason it is,
that they are so highly esteemed in summer; they have the
effect, also, of removing from the stomach distaste for food,
and of promoting the appetite. At all events, we find it
stated, that the late Emperor Augustus, when ill, was saved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
on one occasion,<a id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> thanks to the skill of his physician, Musa,<a id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a>
by eating lettuces, a food which the excessive scruples of his
former physician, C. &AElig;milius, had forbidden him. At the
present day, however, lettuces have risen into such high estimation,
that a method has been discovered even of preserving
them during the months in which they are out of season, by
keeping them in oxymel.<a id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a> It is generally supposed, also,
that lettuces have the effect of making blood.</p>

<p>In addition to the above varieties, there is another kind of
lettuce known as the “goats’ lettuce,”<a id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> of which we shall have
occasion to make further mention when we come to the medicinal
plants: at the moment, too, that I am writing this, a
new species of cultivated lettuce has been introduced, known
as the Cilician lettuce, and held in very considerable esteem;
the leaf of it is similar to that of the Cappadocian lettuce,
except that it is crisped, and somewhat larger.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_39"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 39.—ENDIVE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Endive, though it cannot exactly be said to be of the same
genus as the lettuce, still cannot be pronounced to belong to
any other.<a id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> It is a plant better able to endure the rigours
of the winter than the lettuce,<a id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> and possessed of a more acrid
taste, though the flavour of the stalk<a id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> is equally agreeable.
Endive is sown at the beginning of spring, and transplanted
at the end of that season. There is also a kind of spreading<a id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a>
endive, known in Egypt as “cichorium,”<a id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> of which we
shall have occasion<a id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> to speak elsewhere more at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>A method has been discovered of preserving all the thyrsi
or leaves of the lettuce in pots, the object being to have them
fresh when wanted for boiling. Lettuces may be sown all the
year<a id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> through in a good soil, well-watered and carefully manured;<a id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a>
two months being allowed to intervene between sowing
and transplanting, and two more between transplanting
and gathering them when ripe. The rule is, however, to sow
them just after the winter solstice, and to transplant when the
west winds begin to prevail, or else to sow at this latter period,
and to plant out at the vernal equinox. The white lettuce is
the best adapted for standing the rigours of the winter.</p>

<p>All the garden plants are fond of moisture; lettuces thrive,
more particularly, when well manured, and endive even more
so. Indeed, it is found an excellent plan to plant them out with
the roots covered up in manure, and to keep up the supply, the
earth being cleared away for that purpose. Some, again, have
another method of increasing their size; they cut them<a id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> down
when they have reached half a foot in height, and cover them
with fresh swine’s dung. It is the general opinion that those
lettuces only will admit of being blanched which are produced
from white seed; and even then, as soon as they begin to
grow, sand from the sea-shore should be spread over them,
care being taken to tie the leaves as soon as ever they begin
to come to any size.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_40"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 40.—BEET: FOUR VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Beet<a id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> is the smoothest of all the garden plants. The Greeks
distinguish two kinds of beet, according to the colour, the
black and the white. The last, which is the kind generally
preferred, has but very little seed, and is generally known as
the Sicilian<a id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> beet; just as it is the white lettuce that is held
in the highest degree of esteem. Our people, also, distinguish
two varieties of beet, the spring and the autumn kinds, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
called from the periods of sowing; although sometimes we
find beet sown in June even. This is a plant, too, that is
sometimes transplanted; and it thrives all the better, like the
lettuce, if the roots are well covered with manure, in a moist
soil. Beet is mostly eaten<a id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> with lentils and beans; it is prepared
also in the same way as cabbage, with mustard more
particularly, the pungency of which relieves its insipidity.
Medical men are of opinion that beet is a more unwholesome<a id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a>
vegetable than cabbage; hence it is that I never remember
seeing it served at table. Indeed, there are some persons who
scruple to taste it even, from a conviction that it is a food
suitable only for persons of a robust constitution.</p>

<p>Beet is a vegetable with twofold characteristics, partaking
of the nature of the cabbage in its leaves and resembling a
bulb in the root; that which grows to the greatest breadth
being the most highly esteemed. This plant, like the lettuce,
is made to grow to head by putting a light weight upon it the
moment it begins to assume its proper colour. Indeed, there
is no garden plant that grows to a larger head than this, as it
sometimes spreads to a couple of feet in breadth, the nature of
the soil contributing in a very considerable degree to its size:
those found in the territory of Circeii attain the largest size.
Some persons<a id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> think that the best time for sowing beet is
when the pomegranate is in flower, and are of opinion that it
ought to be transplanted as soon as it has thrown out five
leaves. There is a singular difference—if indeed it really
exists—between the two varieties of beet, the white kind
being remarkable for its purgative qualities, and the black
being equally astringent. When wine in the vat has been
deteriorated by assuming a flavour like<a id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> that of cabbage, its
original flavour is restored, it is said, by plunging beet leaves
into it.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_41"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 41—CABBAGES; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>Cabbage and coleworts, which at the present day are the
most highly esteemed of all the garden vegetables, were held
in little repute, I find, among the Greeks; but Cato,<a id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> on the
other hand, sings the wondrous praises of the cabbage, the
medicinal properties of which we shall duly enlarge<a id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> upon
when we come to treat of that subject. Cato distinguishes
three varieties of the cabbage; the first, a plant with leaves
wide open, and a large stalk; a second, with crisped leaves, to
which he gives the name of “apiaca;”<a id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> and a third, with a
thin stalk, and a smooth, tender leaf, which with him ranks
the lowest of all. Cabbages may be sown the whole year
through, as we find that they are cut at all periods of the year;
the best time, however, for sowing them is at the autumnal
equinox, and they are usually transplanted as soon as five
leaves are visible. In the ensuing spring after the first cutting,
the plant yields sprouts, known to us as “cym&aelig;.”<a id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a>
These sprouts, in fact, are small shoots thrown out from the
main stem, of a more delicate and tender quality than the
cabbage itself. The exquisite palate, however, of Apicius<a id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a>
rejected these sprouts for the table, and his example was followed
by the fastidious Drusus C&aelig;sar; who did not escape,
however, the censures of his father, Tiberius, for being so
over-nice. After the cym&aelig; have made their appearance the
cabbage throws out its summer and autumn shoots, and then
its winter ones; after which, a new crop of cym&aelig; is produced,
there being no plant so productive as this, until, at last, it is
quite exhausted by its extreme fertility. A second time for
sowing cabbages is immediately after the vernal equinox, the
plants of this growth being transplanted at the end of spring,
that they may not run up into sprouts before coming to a top:
and a third sowing takes place about the summer solstice, the
transplanting being done in summer if the soil is moist, but,
if too dry, in autumn. When moisture and manure are supplied
in small quantities, the flavour of the cabbage is all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
more agreeable, but when they are supplied in greater abundance,
the plants attain a larger size. Asses’ dung is the best
adapted for its growth.</p>

<p>The cabbage, too, is one of those articles so highly esteemed
by epicures; for which reason it will not be amiss if we speak
of it at somewhat greater length. To obtain plants equally
remarkable for their size and flavour, care must be taken first
of all to sow the seed in ground that has had a couple of turnings
up, and then to follow up the shoots as they appear above
ground by moulding them up, care being taken to throw up
the earth over them as they increase in luxuriance, and to let
nothing but the summit appear above the surface. This kind
is known as the Tritian<a id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> cabbage: in money and labour it
costs twice as much as any of the others.</p>

<p>The other varieties of the cabbage<a id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> are numerous—there is
the Cumanian cabbage, with leaves that lie close to the ground,
and a wide, open head; the Aricinian<a id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> cabbage, too, of no
greater height, but with more numerous leaves and thinner—this
last is looked upon as the most useful of them all, for
beneath nearly all of the leaves there are small shoots thrown
out, peculiar to this variety. The cabbage, again, of Pompeii<a id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a>
is considerably taller, the stalk, which is thin at the root,
increasing in thickness as it rises among the leaves, which are
fewer in number and narrower; the great merit of this cabbage
is its remarkable tenderness, although it is not able to
stand the cold. The cabbage of Bruttium,<a id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> on the other hand,
thrives all the better for cold; the leaves of it are remarkably
large, the stalk thin, and the flavour pungent. The leaves,
again, of the Sabine<a id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> cabbage are crisped to such a degree as
to excite our surprise, and their thickness is such as to quite
exhaust the stem; in sweetness, however, it is said to surpass
all the others.</p>

<p>There have lately come into fashion the cabbages known as
the “Lacuturres;”<a id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> they are grown in the valley of Aricia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
where there was formerly a lake, now no longer in existence,
and a tower which is still standing. The head of this cabbage
is very large, and the leaves are almost without number, some
of them being round and smooth, and others long and sinewy;
indeed, there is no cabbage that runs to a larger head than this,
with the sole exception of the Tritian variety, which has a
head sometimes as much as a foot in thickness, and throws out
its cym&aelig; the latest of all.</p>

<p>In all kinds of cabbages, hoar-frost contributes very materially
to their sweetness; but it is apt to be productive of considerable
injury, if care is not taken to protect the pith by
cutting them aslant. Those plants which are intended for
seed are never cut.</p>

<p>There is another kind, again, that is held in peculiar esteem,
and which never exceeds the height of an herbaceous plant;
it is known by the name of “halmyridia,”<a id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> from the circumstance
of its growing on the sea-shore<a id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> only. It will keep green
and fresh during a long voyage even, if care is taken not to let
it touch the ground from the moment that it is cut, but to put
it into oil-vessels lately dried, and then to bung them so as
to effectually exclude all air. There are some<a id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> who are of
opinion, that the plant will come to maturity all the sooner
if some sea-weed is laid at the root when it is transplanted,
or else as much pounded nitre as can be taken up with three
fingers; and others, again, sprinkle the leaves with trefoil seed
and nitre pounded together.<a id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> Nitre, too, preserves the greenness
of cabbage when cooked, a result which is equally ensured
by the Apician mode of boiling, or in other words, by steeping
the plants in oil and salt before they are cooked.</p>

<p>There is a method of grafting vegetables by cutting the
shoots and the stalk, and then inserting in the pith the seed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of another plant; a plan which has been adopted with the wild
cucumber even. There is another kind of wild cabbage, also,
the lapsana,<a id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> which has become famous since the triumphs of
the late Emperor Julius, in consequence of the songs and jokes
of his soldiers more particularly; for in the alternate lines sung
by them, they used to reproach him for having made them live
on lapsana at the siege of Dyrrhachium, and to rally him upon
the parsimonious scale on which he was in the habit of recompensing
their services. The lapsana is nothing more than a
wild cyma.<a id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_42"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 42.—WILD AND CULTIVATED ASPARAGUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of all the garden plants, asparagus is the one that requires
the most delicate attention in its cultivation. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a>
spoken at considerable length of its origin, when treating of
the wild plants, and have mentioned that Cato<a id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> recommends
it to be grown in reed-beds. There is another kind, again, of
a more uncultivated nature than the garden asparagus, but less
pungent than corruda;<a id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> it grows upon the mountains in different
countries, and the plains of Upper Germany are quite
full of it, so much so, indeed, that it was a not unhappy remark
of Tiberius C&aelig;sar, that a weed grows there which bears a remarkably
strong resemblance to asparagus. That which grows
spontaneously upon the island of Nesis, off the coast of Campania,
is looked upon as being by far the best of all.</p>

<p>Garden asparagus is reproduced from roots,<a id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> the fibres of
which are exceedingly numerous, and penetrate to a considerable
depth. When it first puts forth its shoots, it is green;
these in time lengthen out into stalks, which afterwards throw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
out streaked branches from the head: asparagus admits, also,
of being grown from seed.</p>

<p>Cato<a id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> has treated of no subject with greater care than this,
the last Chapter of his work being devoted to it, from which
we may conclude that it was quite new to him, and a subject
which had only very recently occupied his attention. He recommends
that the ground prepared for it should be a moist or
dense soil, the seed being set at intervals of half a foot every
way, to avoid treading upon the heads; the seed, he says,
should be put two or three into each hole, these being made
with the dibble as the line runs—for in his day, it should be
remembered, asparagus was only grown from seed—this being
done about the vernal equinox. It requires, he adds, to be
abundantly manured, and to be kept well hoed, due care being
taken not to pull up the young plants along with the weeds.
The first year, he says, the plants must be protected from the
severity of the winter with a covering of straw, care being
taken to uncover them in the spring, and to hoe and stub up
the ground about them. In the spring of the third year, the
plants must be set fire to, and the earlier the period at which
the fire is applied, the better they will thrive. Hence it is,
that as reed-beds<a id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> grow all the more rapidly after being fired,
asparagus is found to be a crop remarkably well suited for
growing with them. The same author recommends, however,
that asparagus should not be hoed before the plants have made
their appearance above-ground, for fear of disturbing the roots;
and he says that in gathering the heads, they should be cut
close to the root, and not broken off at the surface, a method
which is sure to make them run to stalk and die. They should
be cut, he says, until they are left to run to seed, and after the
seed is ripe, in spring they must be fired, care being taken, as
soon as they appear again, to hoe and manure them as before.
After eight or nine years, he says, when the plants have become
old, they must be renewed, after digging and manuring
the ground, by replanting the roots at intervals of a foot, care
being taken to employ sheep’s dung more particularly for the
purpose, other kinds of manure being apt to produce weeds.</p>

<p>No method of cultivating this plant that has since been tried
has been found more eligible than this, with the sole exception
that the seed is now sown about the ides of February, by laying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
it in heaps in small trenches, after steeping it a considerable
time in manure; the result of which is that the roots become
matted, and form into spongy tufts, which are planted out at
intervals of a foot after the autumnal equinox, the plants continuing
to be productive so long as ten years even. There is
no soil more favourable to the growth of asparagus, than that
of the gardens of Ravenna.<a id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a></p>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> spoken of the corruda, by which term I
mean the wild asparagus, by the Greeks called “orminos,” or
“myacanthos,” as well as by other names. I find it stated, that
if rams’ horns are pounded, and then buried in the ground,
asparagus will come up.<a id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_43"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 43.—THISTLES.</span></h3></div>

<p>It really might have been thought that I had now given an
account of all the vegetable productions that are held in any
degree of esteem, did there not still remain one plant, the
cultivation of which is extremely profitable, and of which I
am unable to speak without a certain degree of shame. For
it is a well-known fact, that some small plots of land, planted
with thistles,<a id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> in the vicinity of Great Carthage and of Corduba
more particularly, produce a yearly income of six thousand
sesterces;<a id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> this being the way in which we make the monstrous
productions even of the earth subservient to our gluttonous
appetites, and that, too, when the very four-footed
brutes<a id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> instinctively refuse to touch them.</p>

<p>Thistles are grown two different ways, from plants set in
autumn, and from seed sown before the nones of March;<a id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> in
which latter case they are transplanted before the ides of November,<a id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a>
or, where the site is a cold one, about the time that
the west winds prevail. They are sometimes manured even,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and if<a id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> such is the will of heaven, grow all the better for it.
They are preserved, too, in a mixture of honey and vinegar,<a id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a>
with the addition of root of laser and cummin—so that a day
may not pass without our having thistles at table.<a id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_44"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 44.—OTHER PLANTS THAT ARE SOWN IN THE GARDEN:
OCIMUM; ROCKET; AND NASTURTIUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>For the remaining plants a brief description will suffice. The
best time for sowing ocimum,<a id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> it is said, is at the festival of the
Parilia;<a id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a> though some say that it may be done in autumn as
well, and recommend, when it is sown in winter, to drench
the seed thoroughly with vinegar. Rocket,<a id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> too, and nasturtium<a id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a>
may be grown with the greatest facility either in summer
or winter. Rocket, more particularly, is able to stand
the cold, and its properties are quite different from those of
the lettuce, as it is a great provocative of lust. Hence it is
that we are in the habit of mixing these two plants in our
dishes, the excess of cold in the one being compensated by the
equal degree of heat in the other. Nasturtium has received
that name from<a id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> the smarting sensation which its pungency
causes to the nostrils, and hence it is that a certain notion of
smartness has attached itself to the word, it having become quite
a proverbial saying, that a sluggish man should eat nasturtium,
to arouse him from his torpidity. In Arabia, it is said, this
plant attains a size that is quite marvellous.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_45"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 45.—RUE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Rue,<a id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a> too, is generally sown while the west winds prevail,
as well as just after the autumnal equinox. This plant has an
extreme aversion to cold, moisture, and dung; it loves dry,
sunny localities, and a soil more particularly that is rich in
brick clay; it requires to be nourished, too, with ashes, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
should be mixed with the seed as well, as a preservative against
the attacks of caterpillars. The ancients held rue in peculiar
esteem; for I find that honied wine flavoured with rue was
distributed to the people, in his consulship,<a id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> by Cornelius
Cethegus, the colleague of Quintus Flamininus, after the
closing of the Comitia. This plant has a great liking<a id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> for the
fig-tree, and for that tree only; indeed, it never thrives better
than when grown beneath that tree. It is generally grown
from slips, the lower end of which is inserted in a perforated<a id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a>
bean, which holds it fast, and so nurtures the young plant
with its juices. It also reproduces itself;<a id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> for the ends of the
branches bending downwards, the moment they reach the
ground, they take root again. Ocimum<a id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> is of a very similar
nature to rue, except that it dries with greater difficulty.
When rue has once gained strength, there is considerable difficulty
in stubbing it, as it causes itching ulcerations on the
hands, if they are not covered or previously protected by being
rubbed with oil. Its leaves, too, are preserved, being packed
in bundles for keeping.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_46"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 46.—PARSLEY.</span></h3></div>

<p>Parsley is sown immediately after the vernal equinox, the
seed being lightly beaten<a id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a> first in a mortar. It is thought
that, by doing this, the parsley will be all the more crisped,
or else by taking care to beat it down when sown with a roller
or the feet. It is a peculiarity of this plant, that it changes
colour: it has the honour, in Achaia, of forming the wreath
of the victors in the sacred contests of the Nemean Games.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_47"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 47.—MINT.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is at the same season, too, that mint<a id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> is transplanted; or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
if it has not yet germinated, the matted tufts of the old roots
are used for the purpose. This plant, too, is no less fond of a
humid soil than parsley; it is green in summer and turns
yellow in winter. There is a wild kind of mint, known to us
as “mentastrum:”<a id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> it is reproduced by layers, like the vine,
or else by planting the branches upside down. It was the
sweetness of its smell that caused this plant to change its name
among the Greeks, its former name with them being “mintha,”
from which the ancient Romans derived their name<a id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> for it;
whereas now, of late, it has been called by them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡδύοσμον</span>.<a id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a>
The mint that is used in the dishes at rustic entertainments
pervades the tables far and wide with its agreeable odour.
When once planted, it lasts a considerable length of time; it
bears, too, a strong resemblance to pennyroyal, a property of
which is, as mentioned by us more than once,<a id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> to flower when
kept in our larders.</p>

<p>These other herbs, mint, I mean, and catmint, as well as
pennyroyal, are all kept for use in a similar manner; but it is
cummin<a id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> that is the best suited of all the seasoning herbs to
squeamish and delicate stomachs. This plant grows on the
surface of the soil, seeming hardly to adhere to it, and raising
itself aloft from the ground: it ought to be sown in the middle
of the summer, in a crumbly, warm soil, more particularly.
There is another wild kind<a id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> of cummin, known by some persons
as “rustic,” by others as “Thebaic” cummin: bruised
and drunk in water, it is good for pains in the stomach. The
cummin most esteemed in our part of the world is that of
Carpetania,<a id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> though elsewhere that of Africa and &AElig;thiopia
is more highly esteemed; with some, indeed, this last is preferred
to that of Egypt.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_48"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 48.—OLUSATRUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>But it is olusatrum,<a id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> more particularly, that is of so singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a nature, a plant which by the Greeks is called “hipposelinum,”<a id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a>
and by others “smyrnium.” This plant is reproduced
from a tear-like gum<a id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> which exudes from the stem; it
is also grown from the roots as well. Those whose business
it is to collect the juice of it, say that it has just the flavour of
myrrh; and, according to Theophrastus,<a id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> it is obtained by
planting myrrh. The ancients recommended that hipposelinum
should be grown in uncultivated spots covered with stones,
and in the vicinity of garden walls; but at the present day it
is sown in ground that has been twice turned up, between the
prevalence of the west winds and the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>The caper,<a id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> too, should be sown in dry localities more particularly,
the plot being hollowed out and surrounded with an
embankment of stones erected around it: if this precaution is
not taken, it will spread all over the adjoining land, and entail
sterility upon the soil. The caper blossoms in summer, and
retains its verdure till the setting of the Vergili&aelig;; it thrives
the best of all in a sandy soil. As to the bad qualities of the
caper which grows in the parts beyond the sea, we have
already<a id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> enlarged upon them when speaking of the exotic
shrubs.</p>

<p>The caraway<a id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> is an exotic plant also, which derives its
name, “careum,” from the country<a id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> in which it was first
grown; it is principally employed for culinary purposes. This
plant will grow in any kind of soil, and requires to be cultivated
just the same way as olusatrum; the most esteemed,
however, is that which comes from Caria, and the next best is
that of Phrygia.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_50"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 50.—LOVAGE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Lovage<a id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> grows wild in the mountains of Liguria, its native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
country, but at the present day it is grown everywhere. The
cultivated kind is the sweetest of the two, but is far from
powerful; by some persons it is known as “panax.” Crateuas,
a Greek writer, gives this name, however, to the plant
known to us as “cunila bubula;”<a id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> and others, again, call
the conyza<a id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> or cunilago, cunila, while they call cunila,<a id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a>
properly so called, by the name of “thymbra.” With us
cunila has another appellation, being generally known as
“satureia,” and reckoned among the seasoning plants. It is
usually sown in the month of February, and for utility rivals
wild marjoram. These two plants are never used together,
their properties being so extremely similar; but it is only
the wild marjoram of Egypt that is considered superior to
cunila.</p>

<p>Dittander,<a id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> too, was originally an exotic plant: it is usually
sown after the west winds have begun to prevail. As soon as
it begins to shoot, it is cut down close to the ground, after
which it is hoed and manured, a process which is repeated the
succeeding year. After this, the shoots are fit for use, if the
rigour of the winter has not injured them; for it is a plant
quite unable to withstand any inclemency<a id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> of the weather. It
grows to the height of a cubit, and has a leaf like that of the
laurel,<a id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a> but softer; it is never used except in combination

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_53"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 53.—THE POPPY.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are certain plants which are grown in company<a id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> with
others, the poppy, for instance, sown with cabbages and purslain,
and rocket with lettuce. Of the cultivated poppy<a id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> there
are three kinds, the first being the white<a id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a> poppy, the seed of
which, parched, and mixed with honey, used to be served up
in the second course at the tables of the ancients; at the present
day, too, the country people sprinkle it on the upper crust
of their bread, making it adhere by means of the yolk of eggs,
the under crust being seasoned with parsley and gith to
heighten the flavour of the flour. The second kind is the
black<a id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> poppy, from which, upon an incision being made in the
stalk, a milky juice distils; and the third is that known to the
Greeks by the name of “rhœas;”<a id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> and by us as the wild
poppy. This last grows spontaneously, but in fields, more
particularly, which have been sown with barley: it bears a
strong resemblance to rocket, grows to the height of a cubit,
and bears a red flower, which quickly fades; it is to this
flower that it is indebted for its Greek name.<a id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a></p>

<p>As to the other kinds of poppies which spring up spontaneously,
we shall have occasion to speak of them when treating

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_54"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 54.—OTHER PLANTS WHICH REQUIRE TO BE SOWN AT THE
AUTUMNAL EQUINOX.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are some other plants, again, which require to be
sown together at the time of the autumnal equinox; coriander,
for instance, anise, orage, mallows, lapathum, chervil, known to
the Greeks as “p&aelig;deros,”<a id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> and mustard,<a id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> which has so pungent
a flavour, that it burns like fire, though at the same time
it is remarkably wholesome for the body. This last, though
it will grow without cultivation, is considerably improved by
being transplanted; though, on the other hand, it is extremely
difficult to rid the soil of it when once sown there, the seed
when it falls germinating immediately. This seed, when
cooked in the saucepan,<a id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> is employed even for making ragouts,
its pungency being rendered imperceptible by boiling; the
leaves, too, are boiled just the same way as those of other
vegetables.</p>

<p>There are three different kinds of mustard,<a id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> the first of a
thin, slender form, the second, with a leaf like that of the
rape, and the third, with that of rocket: the best seed comes
from Egypt. The Athenians have given mustard the name of
“napy,”<a id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> others, “thapsi,”<a id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> and others, again, “saurion.”<a id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a></p>

those of Thrace, for example, where<a id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> branches of these wild

the people of Sicyon seek for wild thyme on their mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and the Athenians on the slopes of Hymettus. Sisymbrium,
too, is planted in a similar manner; it grows to the greatest
perfection upon the walls of wells, and around fish preserves
and ponds.<a id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_56"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 56. (9.)—FOUR KINDS OF FERULACEOUS PLANTS. HEMP.</span></h3></div>

<p>The other garden plants are of the ferulaceous kind, such as
fennel, for instance, very grateful to serpents, as already
stated,<a id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> and used for numerous seasonings when dried; thapsia,
too, which bears a close resemblance to fennel, and already
mentioned by us when speaking<a id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> of the exotic shrubs. Then,
too, there is hemp,<a id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a> a plant remarkably useful for making
ropes, and usually sown after the west winds have begun to
prevail: the more thickly it is sown, the thinner are the
stalks. The seed is gathered when ripe, just after the autumnal
equinox, and is dried by the agency of the sun, the wind, or
smoke.<a id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> The hemp itself is plucked just after vintage-time,
and is peeled and cleaned by the labourers at night.</p>

<p>The best hemp is that of Alabanda,<a id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> which is used more
particularly for making hunting-nets, and of which there are
three varieties. The hemp which lies nearest the bark or the
pith is the least valuable, while that which lies in the middle,
and hence has the name of “mesa,” is the most esteemed.
The hemp of Mylasa<a id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> occupies the second rank. With reference
to the size to which it grows, that of Rosea,<a id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> in the
Sabine territory, equals the trees in height.<a id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a></p>

<p>We have already mentioned two kinds of fennel-giant when
speaking<a id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> of the exotic shrubs: the seed of it is used in Italy
for food; the plant, too, admits of being preserved, and, if
stored in earthen pots, will keep for a whole year. There are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
two parts of it that are used for this purpose, the upper stalks
and the umbels of the plant. This kind of fennel is sometimes
known by the name of “corymbia,” and the parts preserved
are called “corymbi.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_57"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 57. (10.)—THE MALADIES OF GARDEN PLANTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The garden plants, too, like the rest of the vegetable productions,
are subject to certain maladies. Thus, for<a id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> instance,
ocimum, when old, degenerates into wild thyme, and sisymbrium<a id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a>
into mint, while the seed of an old cabbage produces
rape, and vice vers&acirc;. Cummin, too, if not kept well hoed, is
killed by h&aelig;modorum,<a id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a>, a plant with a single stalk, a root similar
to a bulb in appearance, and never found except in a
thin, meagre soil. Besides this, cummin is liable to a peculiar
disease of its own, the scab:<a id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> ocimum, too, turns pale at the
rising of the Dog-star. All plants, indeed, will turn of a
yellow complexion on the approach of a woman who has the
menstrual discharge<a id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> upon her.</p>

<p>There are various kinds of insects,<a id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> too, that breed upon the
garden plants—fleas, for instance, upon turnips, and caterpillars
and maggots upon radishes, as well as lettuces and cabbages;
besides which, the last two are exposed to the attacks
of slugs and snails. The leek, too, is infested with peculiar
insects of its own; which may very easily be taken, however,
by laying dung upon the plants, the insects being in the habit
of burrowing in it. Sabinus Tiro says, in his book entitled
“Cepurica,”<a id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> which he dedicated to M&aelig;cenas, that it is not
advisable to touch rue, cunila, mint, or ocimum with any implement
of iron.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_58"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 58.—THE PROPER REMEDIES FOR THESE MALADIES. HOW
ANTS ARE BEST DESTROYED. THE BEST REMEDIES AGAINST CATERPILLARS
AND FLIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The same author recommends as a remedy against ants,
which are by no means the slightest plague in a garden that is
not kept well watered, to stop up the mouths of their holes with
sea-slime or ashes. But the most efficient way of destroying
them is with the aid of the plant heliotropium;<a id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> some persons,
too, are of opinion that water in which an unburnt brick
has been soaked is injurious to them. The best protection for
turnips is to sow a few fitches with them, and for cabbages chickpeas,
these having the effect of keeping away caterpillars. If,
however, this precaution should have been omitted, and the
caterpillars have already made their appearance, the best remedy
is to throw upon the vegetables a decoction of wormwood,<a id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> or
else of house-leek,<a id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> known to some as “a&iuml;zo&uuml;m,” a kind of
herb already mentioned by us. If cabbage-seed, before it is
sown, is steeped in the juice of house-leek, the cabbages, it is
said, are sure not be attacked by any insect.</p>

<p>It is said, too, that all caterpillars may be effectually exterminated,
if the skull<a id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> of a beast of burden is set up upon a
stake in the garden, care being taken to employ that of a female
only. There is a story related, too, that a river crab, hung
up in the middle of the garden, is a preservative against the
attacks of caterpillars. Again, there are some persons who are
in the habit of touching with slips of blood-red cornel<a id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> such
plants as they wish to preserve from caterpillars. Flies,<a id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> too,
infest well-watered gardens, and more particularly so, if there
happen to he any shrubs there; they may be got rid of, however,
by burning galbanum.<a id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a></p>

<p>(11.) With reference to the deterioration to which seed is
subject,<a id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> there are some seeds which keep better than others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
such, for instance, as that of coriander, beet, leeks, cresses,
mustard, rocket, cunila, nearly all the pungent plants in fact.
The seed, on the other hand, of orage, ocimum, gourds,
and cucumbers, is not so good for keeping. All the summer
seeds, too, last longer than the winter ones; but scallion seed
is the very worst for keeping of them all. But of those, even,
which keep the very longest, there is none that will keep beyond
four years—for sowing<a id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> purposes, at least; for culinary
purposes, they are fit for use beyond that period.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_59"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 59.—WHAT PLANTS ARE BENEFITTED BY SALT WATER.</span></h3></div>

<p>A peculiar remedy for the maladies to which radishes, beet,
rue, and cunila are subject, is salt water, which has also the
additional merit of conducing very materially to their sweetness
and fertility. Other plants, again, are equally benefitted
by being watered with fresh water, the most desirable for the
purpose being that which is the coldest and the sweetest to
drink: pond and drain-water, on the other hand, are not so
good, as they are apt to carry the seeds of weeds along with
them. It is rain,<a id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> however, that forms the principal aliment
of plants; in addition to which, it kills the insects as they
develope themselves upon them.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_60"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 60. (12.)—THE PROPER METHOD OF WATERING GARDENS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The proper times<a id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> for watering are the morning and the
evening, to prevent the water from being heated<a id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> by the sun;
with the sole exception, however, of ocimum, which requires
to be watered at midday; indeed, this plant, it is generally
thought, will grow with additional rapidity, if it is watered
with boiling water when sown. All plants, when transplanted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
grow all the better and larger for it, leeks and turnips
more particularly. Transplanting, too, is attended with certain
remedial effects, and acts as a preservative to certain plants,
such as scallions, for instance, leeks, radishes, parsley, lettuces,
rape, and cucumbers. All the wild plants<a id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> are generally
smaller in the leaf and stalk than the cultivated ones, and have
more acrid juices, cunila, wild marjoram, and rue, for example.
Indeed, it is only the lapathum<a id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> that is better in a wild state
than cultivated: in its cultivated state it is the same plant
that is known to us as the “rumix,” being the most vigorous<a id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a>
by far of all the plants that are grown; so much so, indeed,
that it is said that when it has once taken root, it will last for
ever, and can never be extirpated from the soil, more particularly
if water happens to be near at hand. Its juices, which
are employed only in ptisans,<a id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> as an article of food, have the
effect of imparting to them a softer and more exquisite flavour.
The wild variety<a id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> is employed for many medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>So true it is, that the careful research of man has omitted
nothing, that I have even met with a poem,<a id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> in which I find
it stated, that if pellets of goats’ dung, the size of a bean, are
hollowed out, and the seed of leeks, rocket, lettuces, parsley,
endive, and cresses is inserted in them, and then sown, the
plants will thrive in a marvellous degree. Plants<a id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> in a wild
state, it is generally thought, are more dry and acrid than when
cultivated.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_61"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 61.—THE JUICES AND FLAVOURS OF GARDEN HERBS.</span></h3></div>

<p>This, too, reminds me that I ought to make some mention
of the difference between the juices and flavours of the garden
herbs, a difference which is more perceptible here than in the
fruits even.<a id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> In cunila, for instance, wild marjoram, cresses,
and mustard, the flavour is acrid; in wormwood<a id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> and centaury,<a id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
bitter; in cucumbers, gourds, and lettuces, watery;
and in parsley, anise, and fennel, pungent and odoriferous.
The salt flavour is the only one that is not to be found<a id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> in
plants, with the sole exception, indeed, of the chicheling<a id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a>
vetch, though even then it is to be found on the exterior
surface only of the plant, in the form of a kind of dust which
settles there.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XIX_CHAP_62"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 62.—PIPERITIS, LIBANOTIS, AND SMYRNIUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>To come to a full understanding, too, both here as elsewhere,
how unfounded are the notions which are generally entertained,
I shall take this opportunity of remarking that panax<a id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> has the
flavour of pepper, and siliquastrum even more so, a circumstance
to which it owes its name of piperitis:<a id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> libanotis,<a id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a>
again, has just the odour of frankincense, and smyrnium<a id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> of
myrrh. As to panax, we have spoken of it at sufficient length
already.<a id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> Libanotis grows in a thin, crumbly soil, and is
generally sown in spots exposed to the falling dews; the root,
which is just like that of olusatrum,<a id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> has a smell in no way
differing from that of frankincense; when a year old, it is extremely
wholesome for the stomach; some persons give it the
name of rosmarinum.<a id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> Smyrnium is a garden herb that grows
in similar soils, and has a root which smells like myrrh: siliquastrum
too, is grown in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Other plants, again, differ from the preceding ones, both in
smell and taste, anise<a id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> for example; indeed, so great is the
difference in this respect, and in their relative virtues, that not
only are the properties of each modified by the other, but quite
neutralized even. It is in this way that our cooks correct
the flavour of vinegar in their dishes with parsley, and our
butlers employ the same plant, enclosed in sachets, for removing
a bad odour in wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a>Thus far, then, we have treated of the garden plants, viewed
as articles of food only; it remains for us now (for up to the
present we have only spoken of their various methods of cultivation,
with some succinct details relative thereto), to enlarge
upon the more elaborate operations of Nature in this respect;
it being quite impossible to come to a full understanding as to
the true characteristics of each individual plant, without a
knowledge of its medicinal effects, a sublime and truly mysterious
manifestation of the wisdom of the Deity, than which
nothing can possibly be found of a nature more elevated. It
is upon principle that we have thought proper not to enlarge
upon the medicinal properties of each plant when treating of
it; for it is a quite different class of persons that is interested
in knowing their curative properties, and there is no doubt
that both classes of readers would have been inconvenienced in
a very material degree, if these two points of view had engaged
our attention at the same moment. As it is, each class will
have its own portion to refer to, while those who desire to do
so, will experience no difficulty in uniting them, with reference
to any subject of which we may happen to treat.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> are now about to enter upon an examination of the greatest
of all the operations of Nature—we are about to discourse to
man upon his aliments,<a id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> and to compel him to admit that he is
ignorant by what means he exists. And let no one, misled by
the apparent triviality of the names which we shall have to
employ, regard this subject as one that is frivolous or contemptible:
for we shall here have to set forth the state of peace
or of war which exists between the various departments of
Nature, the hatreds or friendships which are maintained by
objects dumb and destitute of sense, and all, too, created—a
wonderful subject for our contemplation!—for the sake of man
alone. To these states, known to the Greeks by the respective
appellations “sympathia” and “antipathia,” we are indebted
for the first principles<a id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> of all things; for hence it is that
water has the property of extinguishing fire, that the sun
absorbs water, that the moon produces it, and that each of
those heavenly bodies is from time to time eclipsed by the
other.</p>

he-goat’s blood<a id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a>—in addition to numerous other marvels of
which we shall have to speak on more appropriate occasions,
equal to this or still more wonderful even. My only request is
that pardon may be accorded me for beginning with objects of
a more humble nature, though still so greatly conducive to our
health—I mean the garden plants, of which I shall now proceed

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2. (1.)—THE WILD CUCUMBER; TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> that there is a wild cucumber, considerably
smaller than the cultivated one. From this cucumber
the medicament known as “elaterium” is prepared, being
the juice extracted from the seed.<a id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> To obtain this juice the
fruit is cut before it is ripe—indeed, if this precaution is not
taken at an early period, the seed is apt to spirt<a id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> out and be productive
of danger to the eyes. After it is gathered, the fruit is
kept whole for a night, and on the following day an incision
is made in it with a reed. The seed, too, is generally sprinkled
with ashes, with the view of retaining in it as large a quantity
of the juice as possible. When the juice is extracted, it
is received in rain water, where it falls to the bottom; after
which it is thickened in the sun, and then divided into lozenges,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
which are of singular utility to mankind for healing dimness<a id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a>
of sight, diseases of the eyes, and ulcerations of the eyelids.
It is said that if the roots of a vine are touched with this
juice, the grapes of it will be sure never to be attacked by
birds.</p>

<p>The root,<a id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> too, of the wild cucumber, boiled in vinegar, is
employed in fomentations for the gout, and the juice of it is
used as a remedy for tooth-ache. Dried and mixed with resin,
the root is a cure for impetigo<a id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> and the skin diseases known
as “psora”<a id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> and “lichen:”<a id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> it is good, too, for imposthumes
of the parotid glands and inflammatory tumours,<a id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a> and restores
the natural colour to the skin when a cicatrix has formed.—The
juice of the leaves, mixed with vinegar, is used as an
injection for the ears, in cases of deafness.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 3.—ELATERIUM; TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The proper season for making elaterium is the autumn; and
there is no medicament known that will keep longer than this.<a id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a>
It begins to be fit for use when three years old; but if it is
found desirable to make use of it at an earlier period than
this, the acridity of the lozenges may be modified by putting
them with vinegar upon a slow fire, in a new earthen pot.
The older it is the better, and before now, as we learn from
Theophrastus, it has been known to keep<a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> so long as two hundred
years. Even after it has been kept so long as fifty<a id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a>
years, it retains its property of extinguishing a light; indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
it is the proper way of testing the genuineness of the drug to
hold it to the flame and make it scintillate above and below,
before finally extinguishing it. The elaterium which is pale,
smooth, and slightly bitter, is superior<a id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> to that which has a
grass-green appearance and is rough to the touch.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that the seed of this plant will facilitate
conception if a woman carries it attached to her person,
before it has touched the ground; and that it has the effect of
aiding parturition, if it is first wrapped in ram’s wool, and then
tied round the woman’s loins, without her knowing it, care
being taken to carry it out of the house the instant she is
delivered.</p>

<p>Those persons who magnify the praises of the wild cucumber
say that the very best is that of Arabia, the next being
that of Arcadia, and then that of Cyren&aelig;: it bears a resemblance
to the heliotropium,<a id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> they say, and the fruit, about the
size of a walnut, grows between the leaves and branches. The
seed, it is said, is very similar in appearance to the tail of
a scorpion thrown back, but is of a whitish hue. Indeed,
there are some persons who give to this cucumber the name of
“scorpionium,” and say that its seed, as well as the elaterium,
is remarkably efficacious as a cure for the sting of the scorpion.
As a purgative, the proper dose of either is from half
an obolus to an obolus, according to the strength of the patient,
a larger dose than this being fatal.<a id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> It is in the same
proportions, too, that it is taken in drink for phthiriasis<a id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> and
dropsy; applied externally with honey or old olive oil, it is
used for the cure of quinsy and affections of the trachea.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 4. (2.)—THE ANGUINE OR ERRATIC CUCUMBER: FIVE
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Many authors are of opinion that the wild cucumber is
identical with the plant known among us as the “anguine,”
and by some persons as the “erratic”<a id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> cucumber. Objects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>

by mice. The same authors<a id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> say, too, that a decoction of it in
vinegar, externally applied, gives instantaneous relief in cases
of gout and diseases of the joints. As a remedy, too, for lumbago,
the seed of it is dried in the sun and pounded, being
given in doses of twenty denarii to half a sextarius of water.
Mixed with woman’s milk and applied as a liniment, it is a
cure for tumours which have suddenly formed.</p>

<p>Elaterium promotes the menstrual discharge; but if taken
by females when pregnant, it is productive of abortion. It
is good, also, for asthma, and, injected into the nostrils, for
the jaundice.<a id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> Rubbed upon the face in the sun, it removes

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 5.—THE CULTIVATED CUCUMBER: NINE REMEDIES.

<p>Many persons attribute all these properties to the cultivated
cucumber<a id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> as well, a plant which even without them would
be of very considerable importance, in a medicinal point of
view. A pinch of the seed, for instance, in three fingers,
beaten up with cummin and taken in wine, is extremely beneficial
for a cough: for phrenitis, also, doses of it are administered
in woman’s milk, and doses of one acetabulum for dysentery.
As a remedy for purulent expectorations, it is taken
with an equal quantity of cummin;<a id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> and it is used with hydromel
for diseases of the liver. Taken in sweet wine, it is a
diuretic; and, in combination with cummin,<a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> it is used as an
injection for affections of the kidneys.</p>

<p>The fruit known as pepones<a id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> are a cool and refreshing diet,
and are slightly relaxing to the stomach. Applications are
used of the pulpy flesh in defluxions or pains of the eyes. The
root, too, of this plant cures the hard ulcers known to us as
“ceria,” from their resemblance to a honeycomb, and it acts
as an emetic.<a id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> Dried and reduced to a powder, it is given
in doses of four oboli in hydromel, the patient, immediately
after taking it, being made to walk half a mile. This powder
is employed also in cosmetics<a id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> for smoothing the skin. The
rind, too, has the effect<a id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> of promoting vomiting, and, when
applied to the face, of clearing the skin; a result which is
equally produced by an external application of the leaves of all
the cultivated cucumbers. These leaves, mixed with honey,
are employed for the cure of the pustules known as “epinyctis;”<a id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a>
steeped in wine, they are good, too, for the bites
of dogs and of multipedes,<a id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> insects known to the Greeks by

and noxious to cattle more particularly; the sting being followed
by swelling, and the wound rapidly putrifying.</p>

<p>The smell of the cucumber itself is a restorative<a id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> in fainting
fits. It is a well-known fact, that if cucumbers are peeled and
then boiled in oil, vinegar, and honey, they are all the more
pleasant eating<a id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> for it.</p>

SOMPHUS: ONE REMEDY.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is found also a wild gourd, called “somphos” by the
Greeks, empty within (to which circumstance it owes its
name),<a id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> and long and thick in shape, like the finger: it grows

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 8.—THE COLOCYNTHIS: TEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is another variety of the wild gourd, known as the
“colocynthis:”<a id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> this kind is full of seeds, but not so large as
the cultivated one. The pale colocynthis is better than those
of a grass-green colour. Employed by itself when dried, it
acts as a very powerful<a id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> purgative; used as an injection, it is
a remedy for all diseases of the intestines, the kidneys, and the
loins, as well as for paralysis. The seed being first removed, it
is boiled down in hydromel to one half; after which it is used as
an injection, with perfect safety, in doses of four oboli. It is
good, too, for the stomach, taken in pills composed of the dried
powder and boiled honey. In jaundice seven seeds of it may
be taken with beneficial effects, with a draught of hydromel
immediately after.</p>

<p>The pulp of this fruit, taken with wormwood and salt, is a
remedy for toothache, and the juice of it, warmed with vinegar,
has the effect of strengthening loose teeth. Rubbed in with
oil, it removes pains of the spine, loins, and hips: in addition
to which, really a marvellous thing to speak of! the seeds of
it, in even numbers, attached to the body in a linen cloth,
will cure, it is said, the fevers to which the Greeks have
given the name of “periodic.”<a id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> The juice, too, of the cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
gourd<a id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> shred in pieces, applied warm, is good for ear-ache,
and the flesh of the inside, used without the seed, for corns on
the feet and the suppurations known to the Greeks as “apostemata.”<a id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a>
When the pulp and seeds are boiled together, the
decoction is good for strengthening loose teeth, and for preventing
toothache; wine, too, boiled with this plant, is curative of
defluxions of the eyes. The leaves of it, bruised with fresh
cypress-leaves, or the leaves alone, boiled in a vessel of potters’
clay and beaten up with goose-grease, and then applied to the
part affected, are an excellent cure for wounds. Fresh shavings
of the rind are used as a cooling application for gout, and
burning pains in the head, in infants more particularly; they
are good, too, for erysipelas,<a id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> whether it is the shavings of
the rind or the seeds of the plant that are applied to the part
affected. The juice of the scrapings, employed as a liniment
with rose-oil and vinegar, moderates the burning heats of
fevers; and the ashes of the dried fruit applied to burns are
efficacious in a most remarkable degree.</p>

<p>Chrysippus, the physician, condemned the use of the gourd
as a food: it is generally agreed, however, that it is extremely
good<a id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> for the stomach, and for ulcerations of the intestines
and of the bladder.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 9.—RAPE; NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Rape, too, has its medicinal properties. Warmed, it is used as
an application for the cure of chilblains,<a id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> in addition to which,
it has the effect of protecting the feet from cold. A hot decoction
of rape is employed for the cure of cold gout; and raw
rape, beaten up with salt, is good for all maladies of the feet.
Rape-seed, used as a liniment, and taken in drink, with wine,
is said to have a salutary effect<a id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a> against the stings of serpents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and various narcotic poisons; and there are many persons who
attribute to it the properties of an antidote, when taken with
wine and oil.</p>

<p>Democritus has entirely repudiated the use of rape as an
article of food, in consequence of the flatulence<a id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> which it produces;
while Diocles, on the other hand, has greatly extolled
it, and has even gone so far as to say that it acts as an aphrodisiac.<a id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a>
Dionysius, too, says the same of rape, and more particularly
if it is seasoned with rocket;<a id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> he adds, also, that
roasted, and then applied with grease, it is excellent for pains

<p>The Greeks distinguish two kinds of turnips,<a id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> also, as employed
in medicine. The turnip with angular stalks and a
flower like that of anise, and known by them as “bunion,”<a id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
good for promoting the menstrual discharge in females and for
affections<a id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> of the bladder; it acts, also, as a diuretic. For
these purposes, a decoction of it is taken with hydromel, or else
one drachma of the juice of the plant.<a id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> The seed, parched, and
then beaten up, and taken in warm water, in doses of four
cyathi, is a good remedy for dysentery; it will stop the passage

of the rind of radishes in wine, taken in the morning
in doses of three cyathi, has the effect of breaking and expelling
calculi of the bladder. A decoction, too, of this rind in
vinegar and water, is employed as a liniment for the stings of
serpents. Taken fasting in the morning with honey, radishes
are good<a id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> for a cough. Parched radish-seed, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
radishes themselves, chewed, is useful for pains in the sides.<a id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a>
A decoction of the leaves, taken in drink, or else the juice

for phthiriasis. Pounded radishes, too, are employed as a liniment
for inflammations<a id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a> under the skin, and the rind, mixed

parched and then pounded with honey, will give relief to
asthmatic patients.</p>

<p>Radishes, too, are useful as a remedy for poisons, and are
employed to counteract the effects of the sting of the cerastes<a id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a>

The two physicians of the name of Apollodorus, prescribe
radishes to be given in cases of poisoning by mistletoe; but
whereas Apollodorus of Citium recommends radish-seed pounded
in water, Apollodorus of Tarentum speaks of the juice.
Radishes diminish the volume of the spleen, and are beneficial
for maladies of the liver and pains in the loins: taken, too,
with vinegar or mustard, they are good for dropsy and lethargy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
as well as epilepsy<a id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> and melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> Praxagoras recommends
that radishes should be given for the iliac passion, and
Plistonicus for the cœliac<a id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> disease.</p>

<p>Radishes are good, too, for curing ulcerations of the intestines
and suppurations of the thoracic organs,<a id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> if eaten
with honey. Some persons say, however, that for this purpose
they should be boiled in earth and water; a decoction
which, according to them, promotes the menstrual discharge.
Taken with vinegar or honey, radishes expel worms from the
intestines; and a decoction of them boiled down to one-third,
taken in wine, is good for intestinal hernia.<a id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> Employed
in this way, too, they have the effect of drawing off the superfluous
blood. Medius recommends them to be given boiled to
persons troubled with spitting of blood, and to women who are
suckling, for the purpose of increasing the milk. Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a>
recommends females whose hair falls off, to rub the head with
radishes, and he says that for pains of the uterus, they should
be applied to the navel.</p>

<p>Radishes have the effect, too, of restoring the skin, when
scarred, to its proper colour; and the seed, steeped in water,
and applied topically, arrests the progress of ulcers known as
phaged&aelig;nic.<a id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> Democritus regards them, taken with the food,
as an aphrodisiac; and it is for this reason, perhaps, that some
persons have spoken of them as being injurious to the voice.
The leaves, but only those of the long radish, are said to have
the effect of improving the eye-sight.</p>

<p>When radishes, employed as a remedy, act too powerfully,
it is recommended that hyssop should be given immediately;
there being an antipathy<a id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> between these two plants. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
dulness of hearing, too, radish-juice is injected into the ear.
To promote vomiting, it is extremely beneficial to eat radishes
fasting.</p>

to the parsnip;<a id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> it is good for ulcerations of the cartilages, and
is employed for the cure of fractured bones. The leaves of it,
taken in water, relax the stomach; they have the effect, also,
of keeping away serpents, and, employed as a liniment, are a
cure for the stings of bees, wasps, and hornets. The root,
pulled up before sunrise, and wrapped in wool of the colour
known as “native,”<a id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> taken from a sheep which has just
dropped a ewe lamb, is employed as a bandage for scrofulous
swellings, even after they have suppurated. Some persons
are of opinion, that for this purpose the root should be dug
up with an implement of gold, and that care should be taken
not to let it touch the ground.</p>

<p>Celsus,<a id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> too, recommends this root to be boiled in wine, and
applied in cases of gout unattended with swelling.</p>

<p>The staphylinos, or, as some persons call it, “erratic<a id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a>
parsnip,” is another kind. The seed<a id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> of this plant, pounded and
taken in wine, reduces swelling of the abdomen, and alleviates
hysterical suffocations and pains, to such a degree as to restore
the uterus to its natural condition. Used as a liniment, also, with
raisin wine, it is good for pains of the bowels in females; for
men, too, beaten up with an equal proportion of bread, and
taken in wine, it may be found beneficial for similar pains. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
is a diuretic also, and it will arrest the progress of phaged&aelig;nic
ulcers, if applied fresh with honey, or else dried and sprinkled
on them with meal.</p>

<p>Dieuches recommends the root of it to be given, with hydromel,
for affections of the liver and spleen, as also the sides,
loins, and kidneys; and Cleophantus prescribes it for dysentery
of long standing. Philistio says that it should be boiled
in milk, and for strangury he prescribes four ounces of the
root. Taken in water, he recommends it for dropsy, as well
as in cases of opisthotony,<a id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a> pleurisy, and epilepsy. Persons,
it is said, who carry this plant about them, will never be stung
by serpents, and those who have just eaten of it will receive
no hurt from them. Mixed with axle-grease,<a id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> it is applied
to parts of the body stung by reptiles; and the leaves of it are
eaten as a remedy for indigestion.</p>

<p>Orpheus has stated that the staphylinos acts as a philtre,<a id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a>
most probably because, a very-well-established fact, when
employed as a food, it is an aphrodisiac; a circumstance which
has led some persons to state that it promotes conception. In
other respects the cultivated parsnip has similar properties;
though the wild kind is more powerful in its operation, and
that which grows in stony soils more particularly. The seed,
too, of the cultivated parsnip, taken in wine, or vinegar and
water,<a id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a> is salutary for stings inflicted by scorpions. By

proverb, “There is plenty of vegetables in Syria.”<a id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

“gingidion,”<a id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> only that it is smaller than the staphylinos and
more bitter, though it has just the same properties. Eaten

entirely absorbs all humours with which it may happen to be
surcharged.</p>

<p>The wild<a id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> skirret, too, is very similar to the cultivated kind,<a id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a>
and is productive of similar effects. It sharpens<a id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> the stomach,
and, taken with vinegar flavoured with silphium, or with
pepper and hydromel, or else with garum, it promotes the
appetite. According to Opion, it is a diuretic, and acts as
an aphrodisiac.<a id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> Diocles is also of the same opinion; in addition
to which, he says that it possesses cordial virtues for
convalescents, and is extremely beneficial after frequent vomitings.</p>

<p>Heraclides has prescribed it against the effects of mercury,<a id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a>
and for occasional impotence, as also generally for patients
when convalescent. Hicesius says that skirrets would appear
to be prejudicial<a id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> to the stomach, because no one is able to eat
three of them following; still, however, he looks upon them as
beneficial to patients who are just resuming the use of wine.
The juice of the cultivated skirret, taken in goats’-milk, arrests
looseness of the stomach.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_18"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 18.—SILE, OR HARTWORT: TWELVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>As the similitude which exists between their Greek names<a id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a>
has caused most persons to mistake the one for the other, we
have thought it as well to give some account here of sile or
hartwort,<a id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> though it is a plant which is very generally known.
The best hartwort is that of Massilia,<a id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> the seed of it being
broad and yellow; and the next best is that of &AElig;thiopia, the
seed of which is of a darker hue. The Cretan hartwort is the
most odoriferous of the several kinds. The root of this plant has
a pleasant smell; the seed of it is eaten by vultures, it is said.<a id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a>
Hartwort is useful to man for inveterate coughs, ruptures, and
convulsions, being usually taken in white wine; it is employed
also in cases of opisthotony, and for diseases of the liver, as
well as for griping pains in the bowels and for strangury, in
doses of two or three spoonfuls at a time.</p>

<p>The leaves of this plant are useful also, and have the effect
of aiding parturition—in animals even: indeed, it is generally
said that roes,<a id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> when about to bring forth, are in the habit of
eating these leaves in particular. They are topically applied,
also, in erysipelas; and either the leaves or the seed, taken fasting
in the morning, are very beneficial to the digestion. Hartwort
has the effect, too, of arresting looseness in cattle, either
bruised and put into their drink, or else eaten by them after it
has been chewed with salt. When oxen are in a diseased state,
it is beaten up and poured into their food.</p>

<p>Elecampane,<a id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> too, chewed fasting, has the effect of strengthening
the teeth, if, from the moment that it is plucked, it is
not allowed to touch the ground: a confection of it is a cure
for cough. The juice of the root boiled is an expellent of intestinal
tapeworm; and dried in the shade and reduced to
powder, the root<a id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> is curative in cases of cough, convulsions,
flatulency, and affections of the trachea. It is useful too, for
the bites of venomous animals; and the leaves steeped in wine
are applied topically for pains in the loins.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_20"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 20.—ONIONS: TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are no such things in existence as wild onions. The
cultivated onion is employed for the cure of dimness<a id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> of sight,
the patient being made to smell at it till tears come into the
eyes: it is still better even if the eyes are rubbed with the
juice. It is said, too, that onions are soporific,<a id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> and that they
are a cure for ulcerations of the mouth, if chewed with bread.
Fresh onions in vinegar, applied topically, or dried onions with
wine and honey, are good for the bites of dogs, care being
taken not to remove the bandage till the end of a couple of
days. Applied, too, in the same way, they are good for healing
excoriations. Roasted in hot ashes, many persons have
applied them topically, with barley meal, for defluxions of the
eyes and ulcerations of the genitals. The juice, too, is employed
as an ointment for sores of the eyes, albugo,<a id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> and
argema.<a id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> Mixed with honey, it is used as a liniment for the
stings<a id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> of serpents and all kinds of ulcerous sores. In combination
with woman’s milk, it is employed for affections of the
ears; and in cases of singing in the ears and hardness of hearing,
it is injected into those organs with goose-grease or honey.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
In cases where persons have been suddenly struck dumb, it
has been administered to them to drink, mixed with water.
In cases, too, of toothache, it is sometimes introduced into
the mouth as a gargle for the teeth; it is an excellent
remedy also for all kinds of wounds made by animals, scorpions
more particularly.</p>

<p>In cases of alopecy<a id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> and itch-scab, bruised onions are rubbed
on the parts affected: they are also given boiled to persons
afflicted with dysentery or lumbago. Onion peelings, burnt to
ashes and mixed with vinegar, are employed topically for stings
of serpents and multipedes.<a id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a></p>

<p>In other respects, there are remarkable differences of opinion
among medical men. The more modern writers have
stated that onions are good for the thoracic organs and the
digestion, but that they are productive of flatulency and thirst.
The school of Asclepiades maintains that, used as an aliment,
onions impart a florid<a id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> colour to the complexion, and that,
taken fasting every day, they are promoters of robustness and
health; that as a diet, too, they are good for the stomach by
acting upon the spirits, and have the effect of relaxing the
bowels. He says, too, that, employed as a suppository,
onions disperse piles, and that the juice of them, taken in
combination with juice of fennel, is wonderfully beneficial in
cases of incipient dropsy. It is said, too, that the juice, taken
with rue and honey, is good for quinsy, and has the effect of
dispelling lethargy.<a id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> Varro assures us that onions, pounded
with salt and vinegar and then dried, will never be attacked
by worms.<a id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a></p>

the nostrils being plugged with the plant, pounded, or else
mixed with nut-galls or mint. The juice of it, taken with
woman’s milk, arrests floodings after a miscarriage; and it is
remedial in cases even of inveterate cough, and of affections
of the chest<a id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> and lungs. The leaves, applied topically, are
employed for the cure of pimples, burns, and epinyctis<a id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a>—this
last being the name given to an ulcer, known also as
“syce,”<a id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a> situate in the corner of the eye, from which there
is a continual running: some persons, however, give this
name to livid pustules, which cause great restlessness in the
night. Other kinds of ulcers, too, are treated with leeks
beaten up with honey: used with vinegar, they are extensively
employed also for the bites of wild beasts, as well as
of serpents and other venomous creatures. Mixed with goats’
gall, or else honied wine in equal proportions, they are used
for affections of the ears, and, combined with woman’s milk,
for singing in the ears. In cases of head-ache, the juice is
injected into the nostrils, or else into the ear at bed-time,
two spoonfuls of juice to one of honey.</p>

<p>This juice is taken too with pure wine,<a id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a> for the stings of
serpents and scorpions, and, mixed with a semi-sextarius of
wine, for lumbago. The juice, or the leek itself, eaten as a
food, is very beneficial to persons troubled with spitting of
blood, phthisis, or inveterate catarrhs; in cases also of jaundice
or dropsy, and for nephretic pains, it is taken in barley-water,
in doses of one acetabulum of juice. The same dose,
too, mixed with honey, effectually purges the uterus. Leeks
are eaten, too, in cases of poisoning by fungi,<a id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> and are applied
topically to wounds: they act also as an aphrodisiac,<a id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> allay
thirst, and dispel the effects of drunkenness; but they
have the effect of weakening the sight and causing flatulency,
it is said, though, at the same time, they are not injurious to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>

prescribes it without being mixed with anything else, and
expressed himself of opinion that it has the property of opening
the uterus when contracted, and that taken as an aliment by
females, it is a great promoter of fecundity. Beaten up and
mixed with honey, it cleanses ulcerous sores. It is good for
the cure of coughs, catarrhs, and all affections of the lungs
and of the trachea, whether given in the form of a ptisan, or
eaten raw, the head excepted: it must be taken, however, without
bread, and upon alternate days, and this even if there
should be purulent expectorations.</p>

<p>Taken in this form, it greatly improves the voice, and acts
as an aphrodisiac, and as a promoter of sleep. The heads, boiled
in a couple of waters, arrest looseness of the bowels, and
fluxes of long standing; and a decoction of the outer coat acts
as a dye upon grey hair.<a id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a></p>

<p>Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> is of opinion also, that fumigations made with
garlic have the effect of bringing away the after-birth; and
he used to employ the ashes of garlic, mixed with oil, for the
cure of running ulcers of the head. Some persons have prescribed
boiled garlic for asthmatic patients; while others,
again, have given it raw. Diocles prescribes it, in combination
with centaury, for dropsy, and to be taken in a split fig,
to promote the alvine evacuations: taken fresh, however, in
unmixed wine, with coriander, it is still more efficacious for
that purpose. Some persons have given it, beaten up in
milk, for asthma. Praxagoras used to prescribe garlic, mixed
with wine, for jaundice, and with oil and pottage for the iliac
passion: he employed it also in a similar form, as a liniment
for scrofulous swellings of the neck.</p>

<p>The ancients used to give raw garlic in cases of madness,
and Diocles administered it boiled for phrenitis. Beaten up,
and taken in vinegar and water, it is very useful as a gargle
for quinsy. Three heads of garlic, beaten up in vinegar, give
relief in toothache: and a similar result is obtained by rinsing
the mouth with a decoction of garlic, and inserting pieces of
it in the hollow teeth. Juice of garlic is sometimes injected
into the ears with goose-grease,<a id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> and, taken in drink, or similarly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
injected, in combination with vinegar and nitre, it arrests
phthiriasis<a id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> and porrigo.<a id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> Boiled with milk, or else beaten
up and mixed with soft cheese, it is a cure for catarrhs. Employed
in a similar manner, and taken with pease or beans, it
is good for hoarseness, but in general it is found to be more
serviceable cooked than raw, and boiled than roasted: in this
last state, however, it is more beneficial to the voice. Boiled in
oxymel, it has the effect of expelling tape-worm and other
intestinal worms; and a pottage made of it is a cure for tenesmus.
A decoction of garlic is applied topically for pains
in the temples; and first boiled and then beaten up with
honey, it is good for blisters. A decoction of it, with stale
grease, or milk, is excellent for a cough; and where persons
are troubled with spitting of blood or purulent matter,
it may be roasted in hot ashes, and taken with honey in
equal proportions. For convulsions and ruptures it is administered
in combination with salt and oil; and, mixed with
grease, it is employed for the cure of suspected tumours.</p>

<p>Mixed with sulphur and resin, garlic draws out the humours
from fistulous sores, and employed with pitch, it will extract an
arrow even<a id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> from the wound. In cases of leprosy, lichen, and
eruptions of the skin, it acts as a detergent, and effects a cure,
in combination with wild marjoram, or else reduced to ashes,
and applied as a liniment with oil and garum.<a id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> It is employed
in a similar manner, too, for erysipelas; and, reduced
to ashes, and mixed with honey, it restores contused or livid
spots on the skin to their proper colour. It is generally believed,
too, that taken in the food and drink, garlic is a cure
for epilepsy, and that a clove of it, taken in astringent wine,
with an obolus’ weight of silphium,<a id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> will have the effect of
dispelling quartan fever. Garlic cures coughs also, and suppurations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of the chest, however violent they may be; to obtain
which result, another method is followed, it being
boiled with broken beans, and employed as a diet till the
cure is fully effected. It is a soporific also, and in general
imparts to the body an additional ruddiness of colour.</p>

<p>Garlic acts as an aphrodisiac, beaten up with fresh coriander,
and taken in pure wine. The inconveniences which
result from the use of it, are dimness of the sight and flatulency;
and if taken in too large quantities, it does injury to
the stomach, and creates thirst. In addition to these particulars,
mixed with spelt flour, and given to poultry in their
food, it preserves them from attacks of the pip.<a id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> Beasts of
burden, it is said, will void their urine all the more easily,
and without any pain, if the genitals are rubbed with garlic.</p>

is given in doses of two oboli, with the addition of one cyathus
of water, to patients for dropsy. The stalk and leaves, bruised

<p>There is a second kind of wild lettuce, known by the Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
is “c&aelig;sapon.”<a id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a> The leaves of this lettuce, applied as a liniment
with polenta,<a id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a> are used for the cure of ulcerous sores. This
plant is found growing in the fields. A third kind, again,
grows in the woods; the name given to it is “isatis.”<a id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> The
leaves of this last, beaten up and applied with polenta, are
very useful for the cure of wounds. A fourth kind is used by
dyers of wool; in the leaves it would resemble wild lapathum,
were it not that they are more numerous and darker.
This lettuce has the property of stanching blood, and of healing
phaged&aelig;nic sores and putrid spreading ulcers, as well as
tumours before suppuration. Both the root as well as the leaves
are good, too, for erysipelas; and a decoction of it is drunk for
affections of the spleen. Such are the properties peculiar to
each of these varieties.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_26"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 26.—HAWK-WEED: SEVENTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The properties which are common to all the wild varieties<a id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a>
are whiteness, a stem sometimes as much as a cubit in length,
and a roughness upon the stalk and leaves. Among these plants
there is one with round, short leaves, known to some persons
as “hieracion;”<a id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> from the circumstance that the hawk
tears it open and sprinkles<a id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> its eyes with the juice, and so dispels
any dimness of sight of which it is apprehensive. The
juice of all these plants is white, and in its properties resembles
that of the poppy.<a id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a> It is collected at harvest-time, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
making incisions in the stalk, and is kept in new earthen
vessels, being renowned as a remedy for numerous maladies.<a id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a>
Mixed with woman’s milk, it is a cure for all diseases of the
eyes, such as argema for instance, films on the eyes, scars and
inflammations<a id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a> of all kinds, and dimness of the sight more
particularly. It is applied to the eyes, too, in wool, as a remedy
for defluxions of those organs.</p>

<p>This juice also purges the bowels, taken in doses of two oboli
in vinegar and water. Drunk in wine it is a cure for the
stings of serpents, and the leaves and stalk of the plant are
pounded and taken in vinegar. They are employed also as a
liniment for wounds, the sting of the scorpion more particularly;
combined, too, with oil and vinegar, they are similarly
applied for the bite of the phalangium.<a id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> They have the
effect, also, of neutralizing other poisons, with the exception
of those which kill by suffocation or by attacking the bladder,
as also with the exception of white lead. Steeped in oxymel,
they are applied to the abdomen for the purpose of drawing out
vicious humours of the intestines. The juice is found good,
also, in cases of retention of the urine. Crateuas prescribes
it to be given to dropsical patients, in doses of two oboli, with
vinegar and one cyathus of wine.</p>

<p>Some persons collect the juice of the cultivated lettuce as well,
but it is not so efficacious<a id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> as the other. We have already made
mention,<a id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> to some extent, of the peculiar properties of the
cultivated lettuce, such as promoting sleep, allaying the sexual
passions, cooling the body when heated, purging<a id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a> the stomach,
and making blood. In addition to these, it possesses no few
properties besides; for it has the effect of removing flatulency,
and of dispelling eructations, while at the same time it promotes
the digestion, without ever being indigestible itself.
Indeed, there is no article of diet known that is a greater stimulant
to the appetite, or which tends in a greater degree to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
modify it; it being the extent, either way, to which it is eaten
that promotes these opposite results. In the same way, too,
lettuces eaten in too large quantities are laxative, but taken in
moderation they are binding. They have the effect, also, of
attenuating the tough, viscous, phlegm, and, according to what
some persons say, of sharpening the senses. They are extremely
serviceable, too, to debilitated stomachs; for which
purpose * *<a id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> oboli of sour sauce<a id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> is added to them, the sharpness
of which is modified by the application of sweet wine, to
make it of the same strength as vinegar-sauce.<a id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> If, again,
the phlegm with which the patient is troubled is extremely
tough and viscous, wine of squills or of wormwood is employed;
and if there is any cough perceptible, hyssop wine
is mixed as well.</p>

<p>Lettuces are given with wild endive for cœliac affections,
and for obstructions of the thoracic organs. White lettuces, too,
are prescribed in large quantities for melancholy and affections
of the bladder. Praxagoras recommends them for dysentery.
Lettuces are good, also, for recent burns, before blisters have
made their appearance: in such cases they are applied with
salt. They arrest spreading ulcers, being applied at first with
saltpetre, and afterwards with wine. Beaten up, they are
applied topically for erysipelas; and the stalks, beaten up
with polenta, and applied with cold water, are soothing for
luxations of the limbs and spasmodic contractions; used, too,
with wine and polenta, they are good for pimples and eruptions.
For cholera lettuces have been given, cooked in the
saucepan, in which case it is those with the largest stalk
and bitter that are the best: some persons administer them,
also, as an injection, in milk. These stalks boiled, are remarkably
good, it is said, for the stomach: the summer lettuce,
too, more particularly, and the bitter, milky lettuce, of
which we have already<a id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> made mention as the “meconis,”
have a soporific effect. This juice, in combination with
woman’s milk, is said to be extremely beneficial to the eyesight,
if applied to the head in good time; it is a remedy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
too, for such maladies of the eyes as result from the action of
cold.</p>

<p>I find other marvellous praises lavished upon the lettuce,
such, for instance, as that, mixed with Attic honey, it is no
less beneficial for affections of the chest than abrotonum;<a id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a>
that the menstrual discharge is promoted in females by using
it as a diet; that the seed, too, Of the cultivated lettuce is
administered as a remedy for the stings of scorpions, and
that pounded, and taken in wine, it arrests all libidinous
dreams and imaginations during sleep; that water, too, which
affects<a id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> the brain will have no injurious effects upon those who
eat lettuce. Some persons have stated, however, that if lettuces
are eaten too frequently they will prove injurious to
the eyesight.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_27"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 27. (8.)—BEET: TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nor are the two varieties of the beet without their remedial
properties.<a id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> The root of either white or black beet, if hung by
a string, fresh-gathered, and softened with water, is said to
be efficacious for the stings of serpents. White beet, boiled
and eaten with raw garlic, is taken for tapeworm; the root,
too, of the black kind, similarly boiled in water, removes porrigo;
indeed, it is generally stated, that the black beet is the
more efficacious<a id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> of the two. The juice of black beet is good
for inveterate head-aches and vertigo, and injected into the
ears, it stops singing in those organs. It is a diuretic, also,
and employed in injections is a cure for dysentery and jaundice.</p>

<p>This juice, used as a liniment, allays tooth-ache, and is good
for the stings of serpents; but due care must be taken that it is
extracted from this root only. A decoction, too, of beet-root
is a remedy for chilblains.</p>

<p>A liniment of white beet-root applied to the forehead,
arrests defluxions of the eyes, and mixed with a little alum it
is an excellent remedy for erysipelas. Beaten up, and applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
without oil, it is a cure for excoriations. In the same way,
too, it is good for pimples and eruptions. Boiled, it is applied
topically to spreading ulcers, and in a raw state it is employed
in cases of alopecy, and running ulcers of the head. The
juice, injected with honey into the nostrils, has the effect of
clearing the head. Beet-root is boiled with lentils and vinegar,
for the purpose of relaxing the bowels; if it is boiled, however,
some time longer, it will have the effect of arresting
fluxes of the stomach and bowels.</p>

used as an aliment. Applied by way of liniment, it disperses

very beneficial to the liver, kidneys, and stomach. A decoction

are extremely beneficial to the stomach, when distressed by
humours more particularly. Used as food with vinegar, they
are cooling, and, employed as a liniment, they dispel other
humours besides those of the stomach. The roots of the wild
variety are eaten with polenta for the stomach: and in cardiac

MENTIONED BY CATO.</span></h3></div>

<p>It would be too lengthy a task to enumerate all the praises
of the cabbage, more particularly as the physician Chrysippus
has devoted a whole volume to the subject, in which its virtues
are described in reference to each individual part of the
human body. Dieuches has done the same, and Pythagoras
too, in particular. Cato, too, has not been more sparing in its
praises than the others; and it will be only right to examine
the opinions which he expresses in relation to it, if for no
other purpose than to learn what medicines the Roman people
made use of for six hundred years.</p>

<p>The most ancient Greek writers have distinguished three<a id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a>
varieties of the cabbage: the curly<a id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> cabbage, to which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
have given the name of “selino&iuml;des,”<a id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> from the resemblance
of its leaf to that of parsley, beneficial to the stomach, and
moderately relaxing to the bowels; the “helia,” with broad
leaves running out from the stalk—a circumstance, owing to
which some persons have given it the name of “caulodes”—of
no use whatever in a medicinal point of view; and a third,
the name of which is properly “crambe,” with thinner leaves,
of simple form, and closely packed, more bitter than the others,
but extremely efficacious in medicine.<a id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a></p>

<p>Cato<a id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> esteems the curly cabbage the most highly of all,
and next to it, the smooth cabbage with large leaves and
a thick stalk. He says that it is a good thing for headache,
dimness of the sight, and dazzling<a id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> of the eyes, the
spleen, stomach, and thoracic organs, taken raw in the morning,

mint, and root of silphium.<a id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> He says, too, that the virtue of
it is so great that the very person even who beats up this mixture
feels himself all the stronger for it; for which reason he
recommends it to be taken mixed with these condiments, or,
at all events, dressed with a sauce compounded of them. For
the gout, too, and diseases of the joints, a liniment of it should
be used, he says, with a little rue and coriander, a sprinkling
of salt, and some barley meal: the very water even in which
it has been boiled is wonderfully efficacious, according to him,
for the sinews and joints. For wounds, either recent or of
long standing, as also for carcinoma,<a id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> which is incurable by
any other mode of treatment, he recommends fomentations to
be made with warm water, and, after that, an application of
cabbage, beaten up, to the parts affected, twice a-day. He says,
also, that fistulas and sprains should be treated in a similar
way, as well as all humours which it may be desirable to bring
to a head and disperse; and he states that this vegetable,
boiled and eaten fasting, in considerable quantities, with oil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and salt, has the effect of preventing dreams and wakefulness;
also, that if, after one boiling, it is boiled a second time, with
the addition of oil, salt, cummin, and polenta, it will relieve
gripings<a id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> in the stomach; and that, if eaten in this way without
bread, it is more beneficial still. Among various other particulars,
he says, that if taken in drink with black wine, it has
the effect of carrying off the bilious secretions; and he recommends
the urine of a person who has been living on a cabbage
diet to be preserved, as, when warmed, it is a good remedy for
diseases of the sinews. I will, however, here give the identical
words in which Cato expresses himself upon this point:
“If you wash little children with this urine,” says he, “they
will never be weak and puny.”</p>

<p>He recommends, also, the warm juice of cabbage to be injected
into the ears, in combination with wine, and assures us
that it is a capital remedy for deafness: and he says that the
cabbage is a cure for impetigo<a id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> without the formation of
ulcers.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 34.—OPINIONS OF THE GREEKS RELATIVE THERETO.</span></h3></div>

<p>As we have already given those of Cato, it will be as well
to set forth the opinions entertained by the Greek writers on
this subject, only in relation, however, to those points upon
which he has omitted to touch. They are of opinion that
cabbage, not thoroughly boiled, carries off the bile, and has
the effect of loosening the bowels; while, on the other hand,
if it is boiled twice over, it will act as an astringent. They
say, too, that as there is a natural<a id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> enmity between it and the
vine, it combats the effects of wine; that, if eaten before drinking,
it is sure to prevent<a id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> drunkenness, being equally a dispellent
of crapulence<a id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> if taken after drinking: that cabbage
is a food very beneficial to the eyesight, and that the juice of
it raw is even more so, if the corners of the eyes are only
touched with a mixture of it with Attic honey. Cabbage, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
according to the same testimony, is extremely easy of digestion,<a id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a>
and, as an aliment, greatly tends to clear the senses.</p>

<p>The school of Erasistratus proclaims that there is nothing
more beneficial to the stomach and the sinews than cabbage;
for which reason, he says, it ought to be given to the paralytic
and nervous, as well as to persons affected with spitting of
blood. Hippocrates prescribes it, twice boiled, and eaten with
salt, for dysentery and cœliac affections, as also for tenesmus
and diseases of the kidneys; he is of opinion, too, that, as
an aliment, it increases the quantity of the milk in women
who are nursing, and that it promotes the menstrual discharge.<a id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a>
The stalk, too, eaten raw, is efficacious in expelling
the dead fœtus. Apollodorus prescribes the seed or else the
juice of the cabbage to be taken in cases of poisoning by fungi;
and Philistion recommends the juice for persons affected with
opisthotony, in goats’-milk, with salt and honey.</p>

<p>I find, too, that persons have been cured of the gout by eating
cabbage and drinking a decoction of that plant. This decoction
has been given, also, to persons afflicted with the cardiac disease
and epilepsy, with the addition of salt; and it has been administered
in white wine, for affections of the spleen, for a
period of forty days.</p>

<p>According to Philistion, the juice of the raw root should be
given as a gargle to persons afflicted with icterus<a id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> or phrenitis,
and for hiccup he prescribes a mixture of it, in vinegar, with
coriander, anise, honey, and pepper. Used as a liniment, cabbage,
he says, is beneficial for inflations of the stomach; and
the very water, even, in which it has been boiled, mixed with
barley-meal, is a remedy for the stings of serpents<a id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> and foul
ulcers of long standing; a result which is equally effected by
a mixture of cabbage-juice with vinegar or fenugreek. It is
in this manner, too, that some persons employ it topically, for
affections of the joints and for gout. Applied topically, cabbage
is a cure for epinyctis, and all kinds of spreading eruptions
on the body, as also for sudden<a id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> attacks of dimness; indeed, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
eaten with vinegar, it has the effect of curing the last. Applied
by itself, it heals contusions and other livid spots; and
mixed with a ball of alum in vinegar, it is good as a liniment
for leprosy and itch-scabs: used in this way, too, it prevents
the hair from falling off.</p>

<p>Epicharmus assures us that, applied topically, cabbage is
extremely beneficial for diseases of the testes and genitals, and
even better still when employed with bruised beans; he says,
too, that it is a cure for convulsions; that, in combination
with rue, it is good for the burning heats of fever and maladies
of the stomach; and that, with rue-seed, it brings away the
after-birth. It is of use, also, for the bite of the shrew-mouse.
Dried cabbage-leaves, reduced to a powder, are a cathartic both
by vomit and by stool.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_35"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 35.—CABBAGE-SPROUTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>In all varieties of the cabbage, the part most agreeable to
the taste is the cyma,<a id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> although no use is made of it in medicine,
as it is difficult to digest, and by no means beneficial to
the kidneys. At the same time, too, it should not be omitted,
that the water in which it has been boiled,<a id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> and which is so
highly praised for many purposes, gives out a very bad smell
when poured upon the ground. The ashes of dried cabbage-stalks
are generally reckoned among the caustic substances:
mixed with stale grease, they are employed for sciatica,
and, used as a liniment, in the form of a depilatory, together
with silphium<a id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> and vinegar, they prevent hair that has
been once removed from growing again. These ashes, too, are
taken lukewarm in oil, or else by themselves, for convulsions,
internal ruptures, and the effects of falls with violence.</p>

<p>And are we to say then that the cabbage is possessed of no
evil qualities whatever? Certainly not, for the same authors
tell us, that it is apt to make the breath smell, and that it is
injurious to the teeth and gums. In Egypt, too, it is never
eaten, on account of its extreme bitterness.<a id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_36"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 36.—THE WILD CABBAGE: THIRTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Cato<a id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a> extols infinitely more highly the properties of wild or
erratic cabbage;<a id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a> so much so, indeed, as to affirm that the
very powder of it, dried and collected in a scent-box, has the
property, on merely smelling at it, of removing maladies of the
nostrils and the bad smells resulting therefrom. Some persons
call this wild cabbage “petr&aelig;a:”<a id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> it has an extreme antipathy
to wine, so much so, indeed, that the vine invariably<a id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a>
avoids it, and if it cannot make its escape, will be sure to die.
This vegetable has leaves of uniform shape, small, rounded, and
smooth: bearing a strong resemblance to the cultivated cabbage,
it is whiter, and has a more downy<a id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> leaf.</p>

<p>According to Chrysippus, this plant is a remedy for flatulency,
melancholy, and recent wounds, if applied with honey,
and not taken off before the end of six days: beaten up in
water, it is good also for scrofula and fistula. Other writers,
again, say that it is an effectual cure for spreading sores on
the body, known as “nom&aelig;;” that it has the property, also,
of removing excrescences, and of reducing the scars of wounds
and sores; that if chewed raw with honey, it is a cure for
ulcers of the mouth and tonsils; and that a decoction of it used
as a gargle with honey, is productive of the same effect. They
say, too, that, mixed in strong vinegar with alum, in the proportion
of three parts to two of alum, and then applied as a
liniment, it is a cure for itch scabs and leprous sores of long
standing. Epicharmus informs us, that for the bite of a mad
dog, it is quite sufficient to apply it topically to the part affected,
but that if used with silphium and strong vinegar, it is
better still: he says, too, that it will kill a dog, if given to it
with flesh to eat.</p>

<p>The seed of this plant, parched, is remedial in cases of poisoning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
by the stings of serpents, eating fungi, and drinking bulls’
blood. The leaves of it, either boiled and taken in the food
or else eaten raw, or applied with a liniment of sulphur and
nitre, are good for affections of the spleen, as well as hard tumours
of the mamill&aelig;. In swelling of the uvula, if the parts
affected are only touched with the ashes of the root, a cure will
be the result; and applied topically with honey, they are
equally beneficial for reducing swellings of the parotid glands,
and curing the stings of serpents. We will add only one more
proof of the virtues of the cabbage, and that a truly marvellous
one—in all vessels in which water is boiled, the incrustations
which adhere with such tenacity that it is otherwise impossible
to detach them, will fall off immediately if a cabbage is boiled
therein.</p>

<p>Among the wild cabbages, we find also the lapsana,<a id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> a plant
which grows a foot in height, has a hairy leaf, and strongly
resembles mustard, were it not that the blossom is whiter. It

<p>Sea-cabbage<a id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> is the most strongly purgative of all these
plants. It is cooked, in consequence of its extreme pungency,
with fat meat, and is extremely detrimental to the stomach.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_39"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 39.—THE SQUILL: TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In medicine, we give the name of white squill to the male
plant, and of black<a id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> to the female: the whiter the squill, the
better it is for medicinal<a id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a> purposes. The dry coats being first
taken off of it, the remaining part, or so much of it as retains
life, is cut into pieces, which are then strung and suspended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
on a string, at short distances from each other. After these
pieces are thoroughly dried, they are thrown into a jar of the
very strongest vinegar, suspended in such a way, however, as
not to touch any portion of the vessel. This is done forty-eight
days before the summer solstice. The mouth of the jar is then
tightly sealed with plaster; after which it is placed beneath
some tiles which receive the rays of the sun the whole day
through. At the end of forty-eight days the vessel is removed,
the squills are taken out of it, and the vinegar poured into
another jar.</p>

<p>This vinegar has the effect of sharpening the eyesight, and,
taken every other day, is good for pains in the stomach and
sides: the strength of it, however, is so great, that if taken in
too large a quantity, it will for some moments produce all the
appearance of death. Squills, too, if chewed by themselves
even, are good for the gums and teeth; and taken in vinegar
and honey they expel tapeworm and other intestinal worms.
Put fresh beneath the tongue, they prevent persons afflicted
with dropsy from experiencing thirst.</p>

<p>Squills are cooked in various ways; either in a pot with a
lining of clay or grease, which is put into an oven or furnace,
or else cut into pieces and stewed in a saucepan. They are
dried also in a raw state, and then cut into pieces and boiled
with vinegar; in which case, they are employed as a liniment
for the stings of serpents. Sometimes, again, they are roasted
and then cleaned; after which, the middle of the bulb is
boiled again in water.</p>

<p>When thus boiled, they are used for dropsy, as a diuretic,
being taken in doses of three oboli, with oxymel: they are
employed also in a similar manner for affections of the spleen,
and of the stomach, when it is too weak to digest the food,
provided no ulcerations have made their appearance; also for
gripings of the bowels, jaundice, and inveterate cough, accompanied
with asthma. A cataplasm of squill leaves, taken off
at the end of four days, has the effect of dispersing scrofulous
swellings of the neck; and a decoction of squills in oil, applied
as a liniment, is a cure for dandriff and running ulcers of the
head.</p>

<p>Squills are boiled with honey also for the table, with the
view of aiding the digestion more particularly; used in this
way, too, they act upon the inside as a purgative. Boiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
with oil, and then mixed with resin, they are a cure for chaps
on the feet; and the seed, mixed with honey, is applied topically,
for the cure of lumbago. Pythagoras says that a
squill, suspended at the threshold of the door, effectually shuts
all access to evil spells and incantations.<a id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a></p>

<p>Bulbs,<a id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> steeped in vinegar and sulphur, are good for the cure
of wounds in the face;<a id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> beaten up and used alone, they are
beneficial for contractions of the sinews, mixed with wine,
for porrigo, and used with honey, for the bites of dogs; in this
last case, however, Erasistratus says that they ought to be
mixed with pitch. The same author states that, applied topically
with honey, they stanch the flowing of blood; other
writers say, however, that in cases of bleeding at the nose,
coriander and meal should be employed in combination with
them. Theodorus prescribes bulbs in vinegar for the cure of
lichens, and for eruptions in the head he recommends bulbs
mixed with astringent wine, or an egg beaten up; he treats
defluxions of the eyes also with bulbs, applied topically, and
uses a similar method for the cure of ophthalmia. The red
bulbs more particularly, will cause spots in the face to disappear,
if rubbed upon them with honey and nitre in the sun;
and applied with wine or boiled cucumber they will remove
freckles. Used either by themselves, or as Damion recommends,
in combination with honied wine, they are remarkably
efficacious for the cure of wounds, care being taken, however,
not to remove the application till the end of four days. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
same author prescribes them, too, for the cure of fractured
ears, and collections of crude humours in the testes.<a id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a></p>

<p>For pains in the joints, bulbs are used with meal; boiled
in wine, and applied to the abdomen, they reduce hard swellings
of the viscera. In dysentery, they are given in wine mixed
with rain water; and for convulsions of the intestines they
are employed, in combination with silphium, in pills the size of
a bean: bruised, they are employed externally, for the purpose
of checking perspirations. Bulbs are good, too, for the sinews,
for which reason it is that they are given to paralytic patients.
The red bulb, mixed with honey and salt, heals sprains of the
feet with great rapidity. The bulbs of Megara<a id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a> act as a strong
aphrodisiac, and garden bulbs, taken with boiled must or raisin
wine, aid delivery.</p>

<p>Wild bulbs, made up into pills with silphium, effect the
cure of wounds and other affections of the intestines. The
seed, too, of the cultivated kinds is taken in wine as a cure
for the bite of the phalangium,<a id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> and the bulbs themselves
are applied in vinegar for the cure of the stings of serpents.
The ancients used to give bulb-seed to persons afflicted with
madness, in drink. The blossom, beaten up, removes spots
upon the legs, as well as scorches produced by fire. Diocles
is of opinion that the sight is impaired by the use of bulbs;
he adds, too, that when boiled they are not so wholesome as
roasted, and that, of whatever nature they may be, they are
difficult of digestion.</p>

resembling those of the leek, and a red bulbous root. This

<p>Asparagus<a id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> is said to be extremely wholesome as an aliment
to the stomach. With the addition of cummin, it dispels
flatulency of the stomach and colon; it sharpens the eyesight
also, acts as a mild aperient upon the stomach, and, boiled with
wine, is good for pains in the chest and spine, and diseases of
the intestines. For pains in the loins and kidneys asparagus-seed<a id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a>
is administered in doses of three oboli, taken with an
equal proportion of cummin-seed. It acts as an aphrodisiac,
and is an extremely useful diuretic, except that it has a tendency
to ulcerate the bladder.<a id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a></p>

<p>The root, also, pounded and taken in white wine, is highly
extolled by some writers, as having the effect of disengaging
calculi, and of soothing pains in the loins and kidneys;
there are some persons, too, who administer this root with
sweet wine for pains in the uterus. Boiled in vinegar the
root is very beneficial in cases of elephantiasis. It is said that
if a person is rubbed with asparagus beaten up in oil, he will
never be stung by bees.</p>

others “libycum,” and by the people of Attica “orminus.”<a id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a>
For all the affections above enumerated it is more efficacious
even than the cultivated kind, that which is white<a id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> more
particularly. This vegetable has the effect of dispelling the
jaundice, and a decoction of it, in doses of one hemina, is
recommended as an aphrodisiac; a similar effect is produced
also by a mixture of asparagus seed and dill in doses of three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
oboli respectively. A decoction of asparagus juice is given
also for the stings of serpents; and the root of it, mixed with
that of marathrum,<a id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> is reckoned in the number of the most
valuable remedies we are acquainted with.</p>

<p>In cases of h&aelig;maturia, Chrysippus recommends a mixture
of asparagus, parsley, and cummin seed, to be given to the
patient every five days, in doses of three oboli, mixed with
two cyathi of wine. He says, however, that though employed
this way, it is a good diuretic, it is bad for dropsy, and
acts as an antaphrodisiac; and that it is injurious to the
bladder, unless it is boiled first.<a id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> He states also, that if the
water in which it is boiled is given to dogs, it will kill them;<a id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a>

<p>Parsley<a id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> is held in universal esteem; for we find sprigs of
it swimming in the draughts of milk given us to drink in
country-places; and we know that as a seasoning for sauces, it
is looked upon with peculiar favour. Applied to the eyes with
honey, which must also be fomented from time to time with a
warm decoction of it, it has a most marvellous efficacy in cases
of defluxion of those organs or of other parts of the body; as
also when beaten up and applied by itself, or in combination
with bread or with polenta. Fish, too, when found to be in
an ailing state in the preserves, are greatly refreshed by
giving them green parsley. As to the opinions entertained
upon it among the learned, there is not a single production

<p>Parsley is distinguished as male and female:<a id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> according to
Chrysippus, the female plant has a hard leaf and more curled
than the other, a thick stem, and an acrid, hot taste. Dionysius
says, that the female is darker than the other kind,
has a shorter root, and engenders small worms.<a id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> Both of
these writers, however, agree in saying that neither kind of
parsley should be admitted into the number of our aliments;
indeed, they look upon it as nothing less than sacrilege to do so,
seeing that parsley is consecrated to the funereal feasts in honour
of the dead. They say, too, that it is injurious to the eyesight,
that the stalk of the female plant engenders small worms,
for which reason it is that those who eat of it become barren—males
as well as females; and that children suckled by females
who live on a parsley diet, are sure to be epileptic. They
agree, however, in stating that the male plant is not so injurious
in its effects as the female, and that it is for this reason
that it is not absolutely condemned and classed among the forbidden
plants. The leaves of it, employed as a cataplasm, are
used for dispersing hard tumours<a id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> in the mamill&aelig;; and when
boiled in water, it makes it more agreeable to drink. The
juice of the root more particularly, mixed with wine, allays
the pains of lumbago, and, injected into the ears, it diminishes
hardness of hearing. The seed of it acts as a diuretic, promotes
the menstrual discharge, and brings away the after-birth.</p>

<p>Bruises and livid spots, if fomented with a decoction of
parsley-seed, will resume their natural colour. Applied topically,
with the white of egg, or boiled in water, and then
drunk, it is remedial for affections of the kidneys; and beaten
up in cold water it is a cure for ulcers of the mouth. The
seed, mixed with wine, or the root, taken with old wine, has
the effect of breaking calculi in the bladder. The seed, too,
is given in white wine, to persons afflicted with the jaundice.</p>

<p>Olusatrum,<a id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> usually known as hipposelinon,<a id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> is particularly
repulsive to scorpions. The seed of it, taken in drink,
is a cure for gripings in the stomach and intestinal complaints,
and a decoction of the seed, drunk in honied wine, is curative
in cases of dysuria.<a id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a> The root of the plant, boiled in wine,
expels calculi of the bladder, and is a cure for lumbago and
pains in the sides. Taken in drink and applied topically, it
is a cure for the bite of a mad dog, and the juice of it, when
drunk, is warming for persons benumbed with cold.</p>

<p>Some persons make out oreoselinon<a id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> to be a fourth species
of parsley: it is a shrub about a palm in height, with an elongated
seed, bearing a strong resemblance to that of cummin,
and efficacious for the urine and the catamenia. Helioselinon<a id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a>
is possessed of peculiar virtues against the bites of
spiders: and oreoselinon is used with wine for promoting the
menstrual discharge.</p>

by some persons as “petroselinon:”<a id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> it is particularly good
for abscesses, taken in doses of two spoonfuls of the juice to
one cyathus of juice of horehound, mixed with three cyathi of
warm water. Some writers have added buselinon<a id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> to the list,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
which differs only from the cultivated kind in the shortness
of the stalk and the red colour of the root, the medicinal
properties being just the same. Taken in drink or applied
topically, it is an excellent remedy for the stings of
serpents.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_48"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 48.—OCIMUM; THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Chrysippus has exclaimed as strongly, too, against ocimum<a id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a>
as he has against parsley, declaring that it is prejudicial to the
stomach and the free discharge of the urine, and is injurious
to the sight; that it produces insanity, too, and lethargy, as
well as diseases of the liver; and that it is for this reason that
goats refuse to touch it. Hence he comes to the conclusion,
that the use of it ought to be avoided by man. Some persons
go so far as to say, that if beaten up, and then placed beneath
a stone, a scorpion will breed there;<a id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> and that if chewed, and
then placed in the sun, worms will breed in it. The people of
Africa maintain, too, that if a person is stung by a scorpion
the same day on which he has eaten ocimum, his life cannot
possibly be saved. Even more than this, there are some who
assert, that if a handful of ocimum is beaten up with ten sea
or river crabs, all the scorpions in the vicinity will be attracted
to it. Diodotus, too, in his Book of Recipes,<a id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> says, that
ocimum, used as an article of food, breeds lice.</p>

<p>Succeeding ages, again, have warmly defended this plant; it
has been maintained, for instance, that goats do eat it, that
the mind of no one who has eaten of it is at all affected, and,
that mixed with wine, with the addition of a little vinegar, it is
a cure for the stings of land scorpions, and the venom of those
found in the sea. Experience has proved, too, that the smell
of this plant in vinegar is good for fainting fits and lethargy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
as well as inflammations; that employed as a cooling liniment,
with rose oil, myrtle oil, or vinegar, it is good for head-ache;
and that applied topically with wine, it is beneficial for
defluxions of the eyes. It has been found also, that it is good
for the stomach; that taken with vinegar, it dispels flatulent
eructations; that applications of it arrest fluxes of the bowels;
that it acts as a diuretic, and that in this way it is good for
jaundice and dropsy, as well as cholera and looseness of the
bowels.</p>

<p>Hence it is that Philistio has prescribed it even for cœliac
affections, and boiled, for dysentery. Some persons, too,
though contrary to the opinion of Plistonicus, have given it
in wine for tenesmus and spitting of blood, as also for obstructions
of the viscera. It is employed, too, as a liniment
for the mamill&aelig;, and has the effect of arresting the secretion
of the milk. It is very good also for the ears of infants, when
applied with goose-grease more particularly. The seed of it,
beaten up, and inhaled into the nostrils, is provocative of
sneezing, and applied as a liniment to the head, of running
at the nostrils: taken in the food, too, with vinegar, it purges
the uterus. Mixed with copperas<a id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> it removes warts. It acts,
also, as an aphrodisiac, for which reason it is given to horses
and asses at the season for covering.</p>

<p>(13.) Wild ocimum has exactly the same properties in every
respect, though in a more active degree. It is particularly
good, too, for the various affections produced by excessive vomiting,
and for abscesses of the womb. The root, mixed with
wine, is extremely efficacious for bites inflicted by wild
beasts.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_49"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 49.—ROCKET: TWELVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The seed of rocket<a id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> is remedial for the venom of the scorpion
and the shrew-mouse: it repels, too, all parasitical insects
which breed on the human body, and applied to the face,
as a liniment, with honey, removes<a id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> spots upon the skin.
Used with vinegar, too, it is a cure for freckles; and mixed
with ox-gall it restores the livid marks left by wounds to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
natural colour. It is said that if this plant is taken in wine
by persons who are about to undergo a flogging, it will impart
a certain degree of insensibility to the body. So agreeable is
its flavour as a savouring for food, that the Greeks have given
it the name of “euzomon.”<a id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> It is generally thought that
rocket, lightly bruised, and employed as a fomentation for the
eyes, will restore the sight to its original goodness, and that
it allays coughs in young infants. The root of it, boiled in
water, has the property of extracting the splinters of broken
bones.</p>

<p>As to the properties of rocket as an aphrodisiac, we have
mentioned them already.<a id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> Three leaves of wild rocket

<p>Nasturtium,<a id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> on the other hand, is an antiaphrodisiac;<a id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> it
has the effect also of sharpening the senses, as already stated.<a id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a>
There are two<a id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> varieties of this plant: one of them is purgative,
and, taken in doses of one denarius to seven of water,
carries off the bilious secretions. Applied as a liniment to
scrofulous sores, with bean-meal, and then covered with a
cabbage-leaf, it is a most excellent remedy. The other kind,
which is darker than the first, has the effect of carrying off
vicious humours of the head, and sharpening the sight: taken
in vinegar it calms the troubled spirits, and, drunk with wine
or taken in a fig, it is good for affections of the spleen; taken
in honey, too, fasting daily, it is good for a cough. The seed
of it, taken in wine, expels all kinds of intestinal worms, and
with the addition of wild mint, it acts more efficaciously
still. It is good, too, for asthma and cough, in combination
with wild marjoram and sweet wine; and a decoction of
it in goats’ milk is used for pains in the chest. Mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
pitch it disperses tumours, and extracts thorns from the body;
and, employed as a liniment, with vinegar, it removes spots
upon the body. When used for the cure of carcinoma, white
of eggs is added to it. With vinegar it is employed also as
a liniment for affections of the spleen, and with honey it is
found to be very useful for the complaints of infants.</p>

<p>Sextius adds, that the smell of burnt nasturtium drives
away serpents, neutralizes the venom of scorpions, and gives
relief in head-ache; with the addition too, of mustard, he says,
it is a cure for alopecy, and applied to the ears with a fig, it
is a remedy for hardness of hearing. The juice of it, he says,
if injected into the ears, will effect the cure of tooth-ache, and
employed with goose-grease it is a remedy for porrigo and
ulcerous sores of the head. Applied with leaven it brings
boils<a id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> to a head, and makes carbuncles suppurate and break:
used with honey, too, it is good for cleansing phaged&aelig;nic
ulcers. Topical applications are made of it, combined with
vinegar and polenta, in cases of sciatica and lumbago: it is
similarly employed, too, for lichens and malformed<a id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> nails,
its qualities being naturally caustic. The best nasturtium of
all is that of Babylonia; the wild<a id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> variety possesses the same
qualities as the cultivated in every respect, but in a more
powerful degree.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_51"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 51.—RUE: EIGHTY-FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>One of the most active, however, of all the medicinal
plants, is rue.<a id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> The cultivated kind has broader leaves and
more numerous branches than the other. Wild rue is more
violent in its effects, and more active in every respect. The
juice of it is extracted by beating it up, and moistening it
moderately with water; after which it is kept for use in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
boxes of Cyprian copper. Given in large doses, this juice has
all the baneful effects of poison,<a id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> and that of Macedonia more
particularly, which grows on the banks of the river Aliacmon.<a id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a>
It is a truly wonderful thing, but the juice of hemlock
has the property of neutralizing its effects. Thus do we find
one thing acting as the poison of another poison, for the juice
of hemlock is very beneficial, rubbed upon the hands and
face<a id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> of persons employed in gathering rue.</p>

<p>In other respects, rue is one of the principal ingredients
employed in antidotes, that of Galatia more particularly.
Every species of rue, employed by itself, has the effect also of
an antidote, if the leaves are bruised and taken in wine. It
is good more particularly in cases of poisoning by wolf’sbane<a id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a>
and mistletoe, as well as by fungi, whether administered in the
drink or the food. Employed in a similar manner, it is good
for the stings of serpents; so much so, in fact, that weasels,<a id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a>
when about to attack them, take the precaution first of protecting
themselves by eating rue. Rue is good, too, for the
injuries by scorpions and spiders, the stings of bees, hornets,
and wasps, the noxious effects produced by cantharides and
salamanders,<a id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a> and the bites of mad dogs. The juice is taken
in doses of one acetabulum, in wine; and the leaves, beaten
up or else chewed, are applied topically, with honey and
salt, or boiled with vinegar and pitch. It is said that people
rubbed with the juice of rue, or even having it on their person,
are never attacked by these noxious creatures, and that
serpents are driven away by the stench of burning rue. The
most efficacious, however, of all, is the root of wild rue, taken
with wine; this too, it is said, is more beneficial still, if
drunk in the open air.</p>

<p>Pythagoras has distinguished this plant also into male and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
female, the former having smaller leaves than the other, and
of a grass-green colour; the female plant, he says, has leaves
of a larger size and a more vivid hue. The same author, too,
has considered rue to be injurious to the eyes; but this is an
error, for engravers and painters are in the habit of eating it
with bread, or else nasturtium, for the benefit of the sight;
wild goats, too, eat it for the sight, they say. Many persons
have dispersed films on the eyes by rubbing them with a mixture
of the juice of rue with Attic honey, or the milk of a
woman just delivered of a male child: the same result has
been produced also by touching the corners of the eyes with
the pure juice of the plant. Applied topically, with polenta,
rue carries off defluxions of the eyes; and, taken with wine,
or applied topically with vinegar and rose oil, it is a cure for
head-ache. If, however, the pain attacks the whole of the
head,<a id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> the rue should be applied with barley-meal and vinegar.
This plant has the effect also of dispelling crudities,
flatulency, and inveterate pains of the stomach; it opens the
uterus, too, and restores it when displaced; for which purpose
it is applied as a liniment, with honey, to the whole of the
abdomen and chest. Mixed with figs, and boiled down to
one half, it is administered in wine for dropsy; and it is taken
in a similar manner for pains of the chest, sides, and loins, as
well as for coughs, asthma, and affections of the lungs, liver, and
kidneys, and for shivering fits. Persons about to indulge in
wine, take a decoction of the leaves, to prevent head-ache and
surfeit. Taken in food, too, it is wholesome, whether eaten
raw or boiled, or used as a confection; boiled with hyssop,
and taken with wine, it is good for gripings of the stomach.
Employed in the same way, it arrests internal h&aelig;morrhage,
and, applied to the nostrils, bleeding at the nose: it is beneficial
also to the teeth if rinsed with it. In cases of ear-ache, this
juice is injected into the ears, care being taken to moderate
the dose, as already stated, if wild rue is employed. For
hardness of hearing, too, and singing in the ears, it is similarly
employed in combination with oil of roses, or oil of laurel,
or else cummin and honey.</p>

<p>Juice of rue pounded in vinegar, is applied also to the
temples and the region of the brain in persons affected with
phrenitis; some persons, however, have added to this mixture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
wild thyme and laurel leaves, rubbing the head and neck as
well with the liniment. It has been given in vinegar to
lethargic patients to smell at, and a decoction of it is administered
for epilepsy, in doses of four cyathi, as also just before
the attacks in fever of intolerable chills. It is likewise
given raw to persons for shivering fits. Rue is a provocative<a id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a>
of the urine to bleeding even: it promotes the menstrual
discharge, also, and brings away the after-birth, as
well as the dead fœtus even, according to Hippocrates,<a id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> if
taken in sweet red wine. The same author, also, recommends
applications of it, as well as fumigations, for affections of the
uterus.</p>

<p>For cardiac diseases, Diocles prescribes applications of rue,
in combination with vinegar, honey, and barley-meal: and
for the iliac passion, he says that it should be mixed with
meal, boiled in oil, and spread upon the wool of a sheep’s
fleece. Many persons recommend, for purulent expectorations,
two drachm&aelig; of dried rue to one and a half of sulphur; and,
for spitting of blood, a decoction of three sprigs in wine. It is
given also in dysentery, with cheese, the rue being first beaten
up in wine; and it has been prescribed, pounded with bitumen,
as a potion for habitual shortness of breath. For persons suffering
from violent falls, three ounces of the seed is recommended.
A pound of oil, in which rue leaves have been
boiled, added to one sextarius of wine, forms a liniment for
parts of the body which are frost-bitten. If rue really is a
diuretic, as Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> thinks, it is a singular thing that
some persons should give it, as being an anti-diuretic, for the
suppression of incontinence of urine.</p>

<p>Applied topically, with honey and alum, it cures itch-scabs,
and leprous sores; and, in combination with nightshade and
hogs’-lard, or beef-suet, it is good for morphew, warts, scrofula,
and maladies of a similar nature. Used with vinegar and oil,
or else white lead, it is good for erysipelas; and, applied with
vinegar, for carbuncles. Some persons prescribe silphium
also as an ingredient in the liniment; but it is not employed
by them for the cure of the pustules known as epinyctis.
Boiled rue is recommended, also, as a cataplasm for swellings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
of the mamill&aelig;, and, combined with wax, for eruptions of
pituitous matter.<a id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> It is applied with tender sprigs of laurel, in
cases of defluxion of the testes; and it exercises so peculiar an
effect upon those organs, that old rue, it is said, employed in
a liniment, with axle-grease, is a cure for hernia. The
seed pounded, and applied with wax, is remedial also for
broken limbs. The root of this plant, applied topically, is a
cure for effusion of blood in the eyes, and, employed as a liniment,
it removes scars or spots on all parts of the body.</p>

<p>Among the other properties which are attributed to rue, it
is a singular fact, that, though it is universally agreed that it
is hot by nature, a bunch of it, boiled in rose-oil, with the
addition of an ounce of aloes, has the effect of checking the
perspiration in those who rub themselves with it; and that,
used as an aliment, it impedes the generative functions.
Hence it is, that it is so often given in cases of spermatorrhœa,
and where persons are subject to lascivious dreams. Every precaution
should be taken by pregnant women to abstain from
rue as an article of diet, for I find it stated that it is productive
of fatal results to the fœtus.<a id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a></p>

<p>Of all the plants that are grown, rue is the one that is most
generally employed for the maladies of cattle, whether arising
from difficulty of respiration, or from the stings of noxious
creatures—in which cases it is injected with wine into the
nostrils—or whether they may happen to have swallowed a
horse-leech, under which circumstances it is administered in
vinegar. In all other maladies of cattle, the rue is prepared
just as for man in a similar case.</p>

doses of two drachm&aelig; to two cyathi of wine, for those of scolopendr&aelig;
and serpents. A decoction, too, of the juice is given
for the sting of the scolopendra.<a id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> Leaves of wild mint are
kept, dried and reduced to a fine powder, as a remedy for
poisons of every description. Spread on the ground or burnt,
this plant has the effect of driving away scorpions.</p>

<p>Taken in drink, wild mint carries off the lochia in females
after parturition; but, if taken before, it is fatal to the fœtus,
It is extremely efficacious in cases of rupture and convulsions,
and, though in a somewhat less degree, for orthopnœa,<a id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> gripings
of the bowels, and cholera: it is good, too, as a topical application
for lumbago and gout. The juice of it is injected into
the ears for worms breeding there; it is taken also for jaundice,
and is employed in liniments for scrofulous sores. It
prevents<a id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> the recurrence of lascivious dreams; and taken in
vinegar, it expels tape-worm.<a id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> For the cure of porrigo, it is
put in vinegar, and the head is washed with the mixture in

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_53"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 53.—MINT: FORTY-ONE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The very smell of mint<a id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> reanimates the spirits, and its
flavour gives a remarkable zest to food: hence it is that it is
so generally an ingredient in our sauces. It has the effect of
preventing milk from turning sour, or curdling and thickening;
hence it is that it is so generally put into milk used for drinking,
to prevent any danger of persons being choked<a id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> by it in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
curdled state. It is administered also for this purpose in
water or honied wine. It is generally thought, too, that it is
in consequence of this property that it impedes generation, by
preventing the seminal fluids from obtaining the requisite consistency.
In males as well as females it arrests bleeding, and
it has the property, with the latter, of suspending the menstrual
discharge. Taken in water, with amylum,<a id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> it prevents
looseness in cœliac complaints. Syriation employed this plant
for the cure of abscesses of the uterus, and, in doses of
three oboli, with honied wine, for diseases of the liver: he
prescribed it also, in pottage, for spitting of blood. It is an
admirable remedy for ulcerations of the head in children, and
has the effect equally of drying the trachea when too moist,
and of bracing it when too dry. Taken in honied wine and
water, it carries off purulent phlegm.</p>

<p>The juice of mint is good for the voice when a person is
about to engage in a contest of eloquence, but only when taken
just before. It is employed also with milk as a gargle for
swelling of the uvula, with the addition of rue and coriander.
With alum, too, it is good for the tonsils of the throat, and,
mixed with honey, for roughness of the tongue. Employed
by itself, it is a remedy for internal convulsions and affections
of the lungs. Taken with pomegranate juice, as Democrites
tells us, it arrests hiccup and vomiting. The juice of mint
fresh gathered, inhaled, is a remedy for affections of the nostrils.
Beaten up and taken in vinegar, mint is a cure for
cholera, and for internal fluxes of blood: applied externally,
with polenta, it is remedial for the iliac passion and tension of
the mamill&aelig;. It is applied, too, as a liniment to the temples
for head-ache; and it is taken internally, as an antidote for
the stings of scolopendr&aelig;, sea-scorpions, and serpents. As a
liniment it is applied also for defluxions of the eyes, and all
eruptions of the head, as well as maladies of the rectum.</p>

<p>Mint is an effectual preventive, too, of chafing of the skin,
even if held in the hand only. In combination with honied
wine, it is employed as an injection for the ears. It is said,
too, that this plant will cure affections of the spleen, if tasted
in the garden nine days consecutively, without plucking it, the
person who bites it saying at the same moment that he does
so for the benefit of the spleen: and that, if dried, and reduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
to powder, a pinch of it with three fingers taken in
water, will cure stomach-ache.<a id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> Sprinkled in this form in
drink, it is said to have the effect of expelling intestinal
worms.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_54"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 54.—PENNYROYAL: TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Pennyroyal<a id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a> partakes with mint, in a very considerable
degree, the property<a id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> of restoring consciousness in fainting fits;
slips of both plants being kept for the purpose in glass bottles<a id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a>
filled with vinegar. It is for this reason that Varro has declared
that a wreath of pennyroyal is more worthy to grace
our chambers<a id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> than a chaplet of roses: indeed, it is said that,
placed upon the head, it materially alleviates head-ache.<a id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a>
It is generally stated, too, that the smell of it alone will protect
the head against the injurious effects of cold or heat, and
that it acts as a preventive of thirst; also, that persons exposed
to the sun, if they carry a couple of sprigs of pennyroyal
behind the ears, will never be incommoded by the heat.
For various pains, too, it is employed topically, mixed with
polenta and vinegar.</p>

<p>The female<a id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a> plant is the more efficacious of the two; it has
a purple flower, that of the male being white. Taken in cold
water with salt and polenta it arrests nausea, as well as pains
of the chest and abdomen. Taken, too, in water, it prevents
gnawing pains of the stomach, and, with vinegar and polenta,
it arrests vomiting. In combination with salt and vinegar,
and polenta, it loosens the bowels. Taken with boiled honey
and nitre, it is a cure for intestinal complaints. Employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
with wine it is a diuretic, and if the wine is the produce
of the Aminean<a id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a> grape, it has the additional effect of dispersing
calculi of the bladder and removing all internal pains. Taken
in conjunction with honey and vinegar, it modifies the menstrual
discharge, and brings away the after-birth, restores the
uterus, when displaced, to its natural position, and expels the
dead<a id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> fœtus. The seed is given to persons to smell at, who
have been suddenly struck dumb, and is prescribed for epileptic
patients in doses of one cyathus, taken in vinegar. If
water is found unwholesome for drinking, bruised pennyroyal
should be sprinkled in it; taken with wine it modifies acridities<a id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a>
of the body.</p>

<p>Mixed with salt, it is employed as a friction for the sinews,
and with honey and vinegar, in cases of opisthotony. Decoctions
of it are prescribed as a drink for persons stung by serpents; and,
beaten up in wine, it is employed for the stings of scorpions,
that which grows in a dry soil in particular. This plant is
looked upon as efficacious also for ulcerations of the mouth,
and for coughs. The blossom of it, fresh gathered, and burnt,
kills fleas<a id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> by its smell. Xenocrates, among the other remedies
which he mentions, says that in tertian fevers, a sprig of
pennyroyal, wrapped in wool, should be given to the patient
to smell at, just before the fit comes on, or else it should be
put under the bed-clothes and laid by the patient’s side.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_55"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 55.—WILD PENNYROYAL: SEVENTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>For all the purposes already mentioned, wild pennyroyal<a id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a>
has exactly the same properties, but in a still higher degree.
It bears a strong resemblance to wild marjoram,<a id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> and has a
smaller leaf than the cultivated kind: by some persons it is
known as “dictamnos.”<a id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> When browsed upon by sheep and
goats, it makes them bleat, for which reason, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Greeks, changing a single letter in its name, have called it
“blechon,”<a id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a> [instead of “glechon.”]</p>

<p>This plant is naturally so heating as to blister the parts of the
body to which it is applied. For a cough which results from
a chill, it is a good plan for the patient to rub himself with it
before taking the bath; it is similarly employed, too, in shivering
fits, just before the attacks come on, and for convulsions
and gripings of the stomach. It is also remarkably good for
the gout.</p>

<p>To persons afflicted with spasms, this plant is administered
in drink, in combination with honey and salt; and it renders
expectoration easy in affections of the lungs.<a id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a> Taken with
salt it is beneficial for the spleen and bladder, and is curative
of asthma and flatulency. A decoction of it is equally
as good as the juice: it restores the uterus when displaced, and
is prescribed for the sting of either the land or the sea scolopendra,
as well as the scorpion. It is particularly good, too, for
bites inflicted by a human being. The root of it, newly taken
up, is extremely efficacious for corroding ulcers, and in a dried
state tends to efface the deformities produced by scars.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_56"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 56.—NEP: NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Nep<a id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> has also some affinity in its effects with pennyroyal.
Boiled down in water to one third, these plants dispel sudden
chills: they promote the menstrual discharge also in females,
and allay excessive heats in summer. Nep possesses certain
virtues against the stings of serpents; at the very smoke and
smell of it they will instantly take to flight, and persons who have
to sleep in places where they are apprehensive of them, will do
well to place it beneath them. Bruised, it is employed topically
for lacrymal fistulas<a id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a> of the eye: fresh gathered and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
mixed in vinegar with one third part of bread, it is applied
as a liniment for head-ache. The juice of it, injected into
the nostrils, with the head thrown back, arrests bleeding at
the nose, and the root has a similar effect. This last is employed
also, with myrtle-seed, in warm raisin wine, as a gargle
for the cure of quinsy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_57"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 57.—CUMMIN: FORTY-EIGHT REMEDIES. WILD CUMMIN:
TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Wild cummin is a remarkably slender plant, consisting of
four or five leaves indented like a saw; like the cultivated<a id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a>
kind, it is much employed in medicine, among the stomachic
remedies more particularly. Bruised and taken with bread,
or else drunk in wine and water, it dispels phlegm and flatulency,
as well as gripings of the bowels and pains in the intestines.
Both varieties have the effect, however, of producing
paleness<a id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> in those who drink these mixtures; at all events, it
is generally stated that the disciples of Porcius Latro,<a id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a> so celebrated
among the professors of eloquence, used to employ this
drink for the purpose of imitating the paleness which had been
contracted by their master, through the intensity of his studies:
and that Julius Vindex,<a id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> in more recent times, that assertor
of our liberties against Nero, adopted this method of playing
upon<a id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> those who were looking out for a place in his will.
Applied in the form of lozenges, or fresh with vinegar, cummin
has the effect of arresting bleeding at the nose, and used by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
itself, it is good for defluxions of the eyes. Combined with
honey, it is used also for swellings of the eyes. With children
of tender age, it is sufficient to apply it to the abdomen. In
cases of jaundice, it is administered in white wine, immediately
after taking the bath.</p>

<p>(15.) The cummin of &AElig;thiopia,<a id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> more particularly, is given
in vinegar and water, or else as an electuary with honey. It
is thought, too, that the cummin of Africa has the peculiar
property of arresting incontinence of urine. The cultivated
plant is given, parched and beaten up in vinegar, for affections
of the liver, as also for vertigo. Beaten up in sweet wine, it
is taken in cases, also, where the urine is too acrid; and for
affections of the uterus, it is administered in wine, the leaves
of it being employed topically as well, in layers of wool.
Parched and beaten up with honey, it is used as an application
for swellings of the testes, or else with rose oil and wax.</p>

<p>For all the purposes above-mentioned, wild cummin<a id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> is more
efficacious than cultivated; as also, in combination with oil,
for the stings of serpents, scorpions, and scolopendr&aelig;. A pinch
of it with three fingers, taken in wine, has the effect of arresting
vomiting and nausea; it is used, too, both as a drink and
a liniment for the colic, or else it is applied hot, in dossils of
lint,<a id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a> to the part affected, bandages being employed to keep it
in its place. Taken in wine, it dispels hysterical affections,
the proportions being three drachm&aelig; of cummin to three cyathi
of wine. It is used as an injection, too, for the ears, when
affected with tingling and singing, being mixed for the purpose
with veal suet or honey. For contusions, it is applied as a
liniment, with honey, raisins, and vinegar, and for dark freckles
on the skin with vinegar.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_58"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 58.—AMMI: TEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is another plant, which bears a very strong resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to cummin, known to the Greeks as “ammi;”<a id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> some
persons are of opinion, that it is the same as the &AElig;thiopian
cummin. Hippocrates gives it<a id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a> the epithet of “royal;” no
doubt, because he looks upon it as possessed of greater virtues
than Egyptian cummin. Many persons, however, consider it
to be of a totally different nature from cummin, as it is so very
much thinner, and of a much whiter colour. Still, it is employed
for just the same purposes as cummin, for we find it
used at Alexandria for putting under loaves of bread, and forming
an ingredient in various sauces. It has the effect of dispelling
flatulency and gripings of the bowels, and of promoting
the secretion of the urine and the menstrual discharge. It is
employed, also, for the cure of bruises, and to assuage defluxions
of the eyes. Taken in wine with linseed, in doses of two
drachm&aelig;, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions; and, used
with an equal proportion of myrrh, it is particularly good for
the bite of the cerastes.<a id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a></p>

<p>Like cummin, too, it imparts paleness of complexion to those
who drink of it. Used as a fumigation, with raisins or with
resin, it acts as a purgative upon the uterus. It is said, too,
that if women smell at this plant during the sexual congress,
the chances of conception will be greatly promoted thereby.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_59"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 59.—THE CAPPARIS OR CAPER: EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already spoken<a id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> of the caper at sufficient length
when treating of the exotic plants. The caper which comes<a id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a>
from beyond sea should never be used; that of Italy<a id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a> is not so
dangerous. It is said, that persons who eat this plant daily,
are never attacked by paralysis or pains in the spleen. The
root of it, pounded, removes white eruptions of the skin, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
rubbed with it in the sun. The bark<a id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> of the root, taken in
wine, in doses of two drachm&aelig;, is good for affections of the
spleen; the patient, however, must forego the use of the bath.
It is said, too, that in the course of thirty-five days the whole
of the spleen may be discharged under this treatment, by urine
and by stool. The caper is also taken in drink for lumbago and
paralysis; and the seed of it boiled, and beaten up in vinegar,
or the root chewed, has a soothing effect in tooth-ache. A
decoction of it in oil is employed, also, as an injection for ear-ache.</p>

<p>The leaves and the root, fresh out of the ground, mixed
with honey, are a cure for the ulcers known as phaged&aelig;nic.
In the same way, too, the root disperses scrofulous swellings;
and a decoction of it in water removes imposthumes of the parotid
glands, and worms. Beaten up and mixed with barley-meal,
it is applied topically for pains in the liver; it is a cure,
also, for diseases of the bladder. In combination with oxymel,
it is prescribed for tapeworm, and a decoction of it in vinegar
removes ulcerations of the mouth. It is generally agreed
among writers that the caper is prejudicial to the stomach.</p>

for the stomach, and is curative of convulsions and flatulency.
There are persons who give this plant the name of “cunila
bubula;” but, as we have already<a id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> stated, they are in error in

varieties of it employed in medicine. That known to us as
“cunila bubula,” has a very similar seed to that of pennyroyal.
This seed, chewed and applied topically, is good for
wounds: the plaster, however, must not be taken off till the
fifth day. For the stings of serpents, this plant is taken in
wine, and the leaves of it are bruised and applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
wound; which is also rubbed with them as a friction. The
tortoise,<a id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> when about to engage in combat with the serpent,
employs this plant as a preservative against the effects of its
sting; some persons, for this reason, have given it the name of
“panacea.”<a id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> It has the effect also of dispersing tumours and
maladies of the male organs, the leaves being dried for the
purpose, or else beaten up fresh and applied to the part affected.

well with wine.</p>

in particular.</p>

a ligneous root, and a rough leaf. Of all the varieties of cunila,
this one, it is said, is possessed of the most active properties.
If a handful of it is thrown anywhere, all the beetles in the
house, they say, will be attracted to it; and, taken in vinegar
and water, it is good for the stings of scorpions more particularly.
It is stated, also, that if a person is rubbed with three leaves
of it, steeped in oil, it will have the effect of keeping all serpents
at a distance.</p>

more velvety leaf, and branches covered with thorns; when

to us as “libanotis,”<a id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> a name which it owes to the resemblance
of its smell to that of frankincense. Both of these plants,
taken in wine or vinegar, are antidotes for the stings of serpents.
Beaten up in water, also, and sprinkled about a place, they kill
fleas.<a id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a></p>

<p>Cultivated cunila<a id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> has also its medicinal uses. The juice
of it, in combination with rose oil, is good for the ears; and
the plant itself is taken in drink, to counteract the effects of
violent blows.<a id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a></p>

<p>A variety of this plant is the mountain cunila, similar to wild
thyme in appearance, and particularly efficacious for the stings of
serpents. This plant is diuretic, and promotes the lochial discharge:
it aids the digestion, too, in a marvellous degree. Both
varieties have a tendency to sharpen the appetite, even when
persons are troubled with indigestion, if taken fasting in drink:
they are good, too, for sprains, and, taken with barley-meal, and
vinegar and water, they are extremely useful for stings inflicted
by wasps and insects of a similar nature.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to speak of other varieties of libanotis<a id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a>

“siliquastrum,” is taken in drink for epilepsy. Castor<a id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a>
used to give a description of it to the following effect: “The
stalk of it is long and red, with the knots lying close together;
the leaves are similar to those of the laurel, and the seed is white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
and slender, like pepper in taste.” He described it also as
being beneficial to the gums and teeth, imparting sweetness

or prasion,<a id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> is the name given to one of these, which is not
unlike hyssop in appearance: it is employed more particularly,
with warm water, for gnawing pains at the stomach, and
for indigestion. Taken in white wine it is good for the stings
of spiders and scorpions; and, applied with vinegar and oil, in
wool, it is a cure for sprains and bruises.</p>

It is diuretic, disperses tumours, and taken in drink is extremely
efficacious in cases of poisoning by mistletoe and stings by serpents.
It is very good for acid eructations from the stomach,

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_69"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 69.—THREE VARIETIES OF HERACLEOTIC ORIGANUM:
THIRTY REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Heraclium,<a id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> again, comprehends three varieties; the first,<a id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
which is the darkest, has broader leaves than the others, and is
of a glutinous nature; the second,<a id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> which has leaves of a more
slender form, and not unlike sampsuchum<a id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> in appearance, is
by some persons called “prasion,” in preference: the third<a id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a>
is of an intermediate nature between the other two, but is
less efficacious for medicinal purposes than either. But the
best kind of all is that of Crete, for it has a particularly agreeable
smell; the next best being that of Smyrna, which has
even a more powerful odour than the last. The Heracleotic
origanum, however, known by the name of “onitis,” is the
one that is the most esteemed for taking in drink.</p>

<p>Origanum, in general, is employed for repelling serpents;
and it is given boiled to persons suffering from wounds. Taken
in drink, it is diuretic; and mixed with root of panax, it is
given for the cure of ruptures and convulsions. In combination
with figs or hyssop, it is prescribed for dropsical patients
in doses of one acetabulum, being reduced by boiling to one
sixth. It is good also for the itch,<a id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> prurigo, and leprosy,
taken just before the bath. The juice of it is injected into the
ears with milk; it being a cure, also, for affections of the
tonsils and the uvula, and for ulcers of the head. A decoction
of it, taken with the ashes in wine, neutralizes poison by
opium or gypsum.<a id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> Taken in doses of one acetabulum, it relaxes
the bowels. It is applied as a liniment for bruises and
for tooth-ache; and mixed with honey and nitre, it imparts
whiteness to the teeth. It has the effect, also, of stopping
bleeding at the nose.</p>

<p>A decoction of this plant, with barley-meal, is employed for
imposthumes of the parotid glands; and, beaten up with nut-galls
and honey, it is used for roughness of the trachea: the
leaves of it, with honey and salt, are good, too, for the spleen.
Boiled with vinegar and salt, and taken in small doses, it attenuates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the phlegm, when very thick and black; and beaten
up with oil, it is injected into the nostrils for jaundice. When
persons are affected with lassitude, the body is well rubbed
with it, care being taken not to touch the abdomen. Used with
pitch, it is a cure for epinyctis, and, applied with a roasted
fig, it brings boils to a head. Employed with oil and vinegar,
and barley-meal, it is good for scrofulous swellings; and applied
topically in a fig, it is a cure for pains in the sides.
Beaten up, and applied with vinegar, it is employed as a liniment
for bloody fluxes of the generative organs, and it accelerates
the lochial discharge after child-birth.</p>

<div class="section">

<p>Dittander<a id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> is generally considered to rank among the caustic
plants. It is owing to this property that it clears the skin of the
face, not, however, without excoriating it; though, at the same
time, the excoriations are easily healed by employing wax and
rose oil. It is owing to this property, too, that it always removes,
without difficulty, leprous sores and itch-scabs, as well
as the scars left by ulcers. It is said, that in cases of tooth-ache,
if this plant is attached to the arm on the suffering side,
it will have the effect of drawing the pain to it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_71"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 71.—GITH, OR MELANTHION: TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Gith<a id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> is by some Greek writers called “melanthion,”<a id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> and
by others “melaspermon.”<a id="FNanchor_1624_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> That is looked upon as the
best which has the most pungent odour and is the darkest in
appearance. It is employed as a remedy for wounds made by
serpents and scorpions: I find that for this purpose it is applied
topically with vinegar and honey, and that by burning
it serpents are kept at a distance.<a id="FNanchor_1625_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> It is taken, also, in doses
of one drachma for the bites of spiders. Beaten up, and smelt
at in a piece of linen cloth, it is a cure for running at the nostrils;
and, applied as a liniment with vinegar and injected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
into the nostrils, it dispels head-ache. With oil of iris it is
good for defluxions and tumours of the eyes, and a decoction
of it with vinegar is a cure for tooth-ache. Beaten up
and applied topically, or else chewed, it is used for ulcers
of the mouth, and combined with vinegar, it is good for
leprous sores and freckles on the skin. Taken in drink, with
the addition of nitre, it is good for hardness of breathing, and,
employed as a liniment, for indurations, tumours of long
standing, and suppurations. Taken several days in succession,
it augments the milk in women who are nursing.</p>

<p>The juice of this plant is collected<a id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> in the same manner as
that of henbane; and, like it, if taken in too large doses, it
acts as a poison, a surprising fact, seeing that the seed is held
in esteem as a most agreeable seasoning for bread.<a id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> The seed
cleanses the eyes also, acts as a diuretic, and promotes the menstrual
discharge; and not only this, but I find it stated also, that
if thirty grains only are attached to the body, in a linen cloth,
it will have the effect of accelerating the after-birth. It is
stated, also, that beaten up in urine, it is a cure for corns on
the feet; and that when burnt it kills gnats and flies with the
smell.</p>

morning with smyrnion<a id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> and a little honey, the mouth being

<p>This plant imparts a youthful look<a id="FNanchor_1632_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> to the features; and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
suspended to the pillow, so as to be smelt by a person when
asleep, it will prevent all disagreeable dreams. It has the
effect of promoting the appetite, also—for this, too, has been
made by luxury one of the objects of art, ever since labour has
ceased to stimulate it. It is for these various reasons that it
has received the name of “anicetum,”<a id="FNanchor_1633_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> given to it by some.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_73"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 73.—WHERE THE BEST ANISE IS FOUND: VARIOUS REMEDIES
DERIVED FROM THIS PLANT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The most esteemed anise is that of Crete, and, next to it,
that of Egypt. This plant is employed in seasonings to supply
the place of lovage; and the perfume of it, when burnt
and inhaled, alleviates headache. Evenor prescribes an application
of the root, pounded, for defluxions of the eyes; and
Iollas employs it in a similar manner, in combination with
saffron and wine, or else beaten up by itself and mixed with
polenta, for violent defluxions and the extraction of such objects
as have got into the eyes: applied, too, as a liniment in
water, it arrests cancer of the nose. Mixed with hyssop and
oxymel, and employed as a gargle, it is a cure for quinsy;
and, in combination with rose oil, it is used as an injection for
the ears. Parched anise purges off phlegm from the chest, and,
if taken with honey, it is better still.</p>

<p>For a cough, beat up fifty bitter almonds, shelled, in honey,
with one acetabulum of anise. Another very easy remedy,
too, is to mix three drachm&aelig; of anise with two of poppies and
some honey, a piece the size of a bean being taken three times
a-day. Its main excellence, however, is as a carminative;
hence it is that it is so good for flatulency of the stomach,
griping pains of the intestines, and cœliac affections. A decoction
of it, smelt at and drunk, arrests hiccup, and a decoction
of the leaves removes indigestion. A decoction of it with
parsley, if applied to the nostrils, will arrest sneezing. Taken
in drink, anise promotes sleep, disperses calculi of the bladder,
arrests vomiting and swelling of the viscera, and acts as an
excellent pectoral for affections of the chest, and of the diaphragm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
where the body is tightly laced. It is beneficial, also,
to pour a decoction of it, in oil, upon the head for head-ache.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that there is nothing in existence
more beneficial to the abdomen and intestines than anise; for
which reason it is given, parched, for dysentery and tenesmus.
Some persons add opium to these ingredients, and prescribe
three pills a-day, the size of a bean, with one cyathus of wine.
Dieuches has employed the juice of this plant for lumbago,
and prescribes the seed of it, pounded with mint, for dropsy
and cœliac affections: Evenor recommends the root, also, for
affections of the kidneys. Dalion, the herbalist, employed it,
with parsley, as a cataplasm for women in labour, as also for
pains of the uterus; and, for women in labour, he prescribes
a decoction of anise and dill to be taken in drink. It
is used as a liniment also in cases of phrenitis, or else applied
fresh gathered and mixed with polenta; in which form it is
used also for infants attacked with epilepsy<a id="FNanchor_1634_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> or convulsions.
Pythagoras, indeed, assures us that persons, so long as they
hold this plant in the hand, will never be attacked with epilepsy,
for which reason, as much of it as possible should be
planted near the house; he says, too, that women who inhale
the odour of it have a more easy delivery, it being his advice
also, that, immediately after they are delivered, it should be
given them to drink, with a sprinkling of polenta.</p>

<p>Sosimenes employed this plant, in combination with vinegar,
for all kinds of indurations, and for lassitude he prescribes a
decoction of it in oil, with the addition of nitre. The same
writer pledges his word to all wayfarers, that, if they take
aniseed in their drink, they will be comparatively exempt
from fatigue<a id="FNanchor_1635_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a> on their journey. Heraclides prescribes a pinch
of aniseed with three fingers, for inflations of the stomach, to
be taken with two oboli of castoreum<a id="FNanchor_1636_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> in honied wine; and he
recommends a similar preparation for inflations of the abdomen
and intestines. In cases of orthopnœa, he recommends a pinch
of aniseed with three fingers, and the same quantity of henbane,
to be mixed in asses’-milk. It is the advice of many to
those who are liable to vomit,<a id="FNanchor_1637_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> to take, at dinner, one acetabulum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of aniseed and ten laurel-leaves, the whole to be
beaten up and drunk in water.</p>

<p>Anise, chewed and applied warm, or else taken with castoreum
in oxymel, allays suffocations of the uterus. It also
dispels vertigo after child-birth, taken with a pinch of cucumber
seed in three fingers and the same quantity of linseed, in
three cyathi of white wine. Tlepolemus has employed a pinch
of aniseed and fennel in three fingers, mixed with vinegar
and one cyathus of honey, for the cure of quartan fever. Applied
topically with bitter almonds, aniseed is beneficial for
maladies of the joints. There are some persons who look upon
it as, by nature, an antidote to the venom of the asp. It is a
diuretic, assuages thirst, and acts as an aphrodisiac. Taken in
wine, it promotes a gentle perspiration, and it has the property
of protecting cloth from the ravages of moths. The more
recently it has been gathered, and the darker its colour, the
greater are its virtues: still, however, it is injurious to the
stomach, except when suffering from flatulency.</p>

<p>Dill<a id="FNanchor_1638_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> acts also as a carminative, allays gripings of the stomach,
and arrests looseness of the bowels. The roots of this
plant are applied topically in water, or else in wine, for defluxions
of the eyes. The seed of it, if smelt at while boiling,
will arrest hiccup; and, taken in water, it dispels indigestion.
The ashes of it are a remedy for swellings of the
uvula; but the plant itself weakens the eyesight and the generative
powers.</p>

KNOWN AS “ANODYNES, FEBRIFUGES, DIGESTIVES, AND
CŒLIACS.” IN WHAT WAY THE JUICES OF THESE PLANTS
ARE TO BE COLLECTED.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_1641_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> stated that there are three varieties of
the cultivated poppy, and, on the same occasion, we promised
to describe the wild kinds. With reference to the cultivated
varieties, the calyx<a id="FNanchor_1642_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> of the white<a id="FNanchor_1643_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> poppy is pounded, and is
taken in wine as a soporific; the seed of it is a cure, also, for
elephantiasis. The black<a id="FNanchor_1644_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a> poppy acts as a soporific, by the
juice which exudes from incisions<a id="FNanchor_1645_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> made in the stalk—at the
time when the plant is beginning to flower, Diagoras says;
but when the blossom has gone off, according to Iollas. This
is done at the third<a id="FNanchor_1646_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> hour, in a clear, still, day, or, in other
words, when the dew has thoroughly dried upon the poppy. It
is recommended to make the incision just beneath the head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
and calyx of the plant; this being the only kind, in fact, into
the head of which the incision is made. This juice, like that
of any other plant, is received in wool;<a id="FNanchor_1647_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> or else, if it is in
very minute quantities, it is scraped off with the thumb nail
just as it is from the lettuce, and so again on the following
day, with the portion that has since dried there. If obtained
from the poppy in sufficiently large quantities, this juice
thickens, after which it is kneaded out into lozenges, and dried
in the shade. This juice is possessed not only of certain soporific
qualities, but, if taken in too large quantities, is productive
of sleep unto death even: the name given to it is “opium.”<a id="FNanchor_1648_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a>
It was in this way, we learn, that the father of P. Licinius
C&aelig;cina, a man of Pr&aelig;torian rank, put an end to his life at
Bavilum<a id="FNanchor_1649_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a> in Spain, an incurable malady having rendered
existence quite intolerable to him. Many other persons, too,
have ended their lives in a similar way. It is for this reason
that opium has been so strongly exclaimed against by Diagoras
and Erasistratus; for they have altogether condemned
it as a deadly poison, forbidding it to be used for infusions
even, as being injurious to the sight. Andreas says, in addition
to this, that the only reason why it does not cause instantaneous
blindness, is the fact that they adulterate it at Alexandria.
In later times, however, the use of it has not been
disapproved of—witness the celebrated preparation known as
“diacodion.”<a id="FNanchor_1650_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> Lozenges are also made of ground poppy-seed,
which are taken in milk as a soporific.<a id="FNanchor_1651_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_1651_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> The seed is
employed, too, with rose-oil for head-ache; and, in combination
with that oil, is injected into the ears for ear-ache. Mixed
with woman’s milk, this seed is used as a liniment for
gout: the leaves, too, are employed in a similar manner.
Taken in vinegar, the seed is prescribed as a cure for erysipelas
and wounds.</p>

<p>For my own part, however, I do not approve of opium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
entering into the composition of eye-salves,<a id="FNanchor_1652_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1652_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a> and still less of
the preparations from it known as febrifuges,<a id="FNanchor_1653_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> digestives, and
cœliacs: the black poppy, however, is very generally prescribed,
in wine, for cœliac affections. All the cultivated<a id="FNanchor_1654_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_1654_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a>
poppies are larger than the others, and the form of the head
is round. In the wild poppy the head is elongated and small,
but it is possessed of more active<a id="FNanchor_1655_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_1655_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a> properties than the others in
every respect. This head is often boiled, and the decoction of
it taken to promote sleep, the face being fomented also with
the water. The best poppies are grown in dry localities, and
where it seldom rains.</p>

<p>When the heads and leaves of the poppy are boiled together,
the name given to the decoction is “meconium;”<a id="FNanchor_1656_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> it is much
less powerful, however, in its effects than opium.</p>

<p>The principal test<a id="FNanchor_1657_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_1657_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a> of the purity of opium is the smell,
which, when genuine, is so penetrating as to be quite insupportable.
The next best test is that obtained by lighting it at
a lamp; upon which it ought to burn with a clear, brilliant
flame, and to give out a strong odour when extinguished; a
thing that never happens when opium has been drugged, for,
in such case, it lights with the greatest difficulty, and the
flame repeatedly goes out. There is another way of testing
its genuineness, by water; for, if it is pure, it will float like a
thin cloud upon the surface, but, if adulterated, it will unite in
the form of blisters on the water. But the most surprising
thing of all is the fact, that the sun’s heat in summer furnishes
a test; for, if the drug is pure, it will sweat and gradually
melt, till it has all the appearance of the juice when fresh
gathered.</p>

<p>Mnesides is of opinion that the best way of preserving
opium is to mix henbane seed with it; others, again, recommend
that it should be kept with beans.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_77"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 77. (19.)—THE POPPY CALLED RHŒAS: TWO REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The poppy which we have<a id="FNanchor_1658_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_1658_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> spoken of under the names of
“rhœas” and the “erratic” poppy, forms an intermediate variety
between the cultivated and the wild poppy; for it grows
in the fields, it is true, but it is self-set nevertheless. Some
persons eat<a id="FNanchor_1659_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_1659_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a> it, calyx and all, immediately after it is gathered.
This plant is an extremely powerful purgative: five heads of
it, boiled in three semi-sextarii of wine, and taken in drink,
have the effect of producing sleep.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_78"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 78.—THE WILD POPPY CALLED CERATITIS, GLAUCIUM, OR
PARALIUM: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is one variety of wild poppy known as “ceratitis.”<a id="FNanchor_1660_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a>
It is of a black colour, a cubit in height, and has a thick root
covered with bark, with a head resembling a small bud, bent
and pointed at the end like a horn. The leaves of this plant
are smaller and thinner than those of the other wild poppies,
and the seed, which is very diminutive, is ripe at harvest.
Taken with honied wine, in doses of half an acetabulum, the
seed acts as a purgative. The leaves, beaten up in oil, are a
cure for the white<a id="FNanchor_1661_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> specks which form on the eyes of beasts
of burden. The root, boiled down to one half, in doses of one
acetabulum to two sextarii of water, is prescribed for maladies
of the loins and liver, and the leaves, employed with honey,
are a cure for carbuncles.</p>

<p>Some persons give this kind of poppy the name of “glaucion,”
and others of “paralium,”<a id="FNanchor_1662_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a> for it grows, in fact, in
spots exposed to exhalations from the sea, or else in soils of a
nitrous nature.</p>

<p>There is another kind<a id="FNanchor_1663_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a> of wild poppy, known as “heraclion”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
by some persons, and as “aphron” by others. The leaves of
it, when seen from a distance, have all the appearance of sparrows;<a id="FNanchor_1664_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a>
the root lies on the surface of the ground, and the seed
has exactly the colour of foam.<a id="FNanchor_1665_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> This plant is used for the
purpose of bleaching linen<a id="FNanchor_1666_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a> cloths in summer. It is bruised
in a mortar for epilepsy, being given in white wine, in doses
of one acetabulum, and acting as an emetic.</p>

<p>This plant is extremely useful, also, for the composition of
the medicament known as “diacodion,”<a id="FNanchor_1667_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> and “arteriace.”
This preparation is made with one hundred and twenty heads<a id="FNanchor_1668_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a>
of this or any other kind of wild poppy, steeped for two days
in three sextarii of rain water, after which they are boiled in
it. You must then dry the heads; which done, boil them
down with honey to one half, at a slow heat. More recently,
there have been added to the mixture, six drachm&aelig; of saffron,
hypocisthis,<a id="FNanchor_1669_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a> frankincense, and gum acacia, with one sextarius
of raisin wine of Crete. All this, however, is only so much
ostentation; for the virtue of this simple and ancient preparation
depends solely upon the poppy and the honey.</p>

persons give it the name of “mecon,” others of “paralion.”
It has a white leaf, resembling that of flax, and a head the size
of a bean. It is gathered when the vine is in blossom, and
dried in the shade. The seed, taken in drink, purges the
bowels, the dose being half an acetabulum, in honied wine.
The head of every species of poppy, whether green or dry, used
as a fomentation, assuages defluxions<a id="FNanchor_1671_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> of the eyes. Opium, if
taken in pure wine immediately after the sting of a scorpion,
prevents any dangerous results. Some persons, however, attribute
this virtue to the black poppy only, the head or leaves
being beaten up for the purpose.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_81"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 81. (20.)—PORCILLACA OR PURSLAIN, OTHERWISE CALLED
PEPLIS: TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is a wild purslain,<a id="FNanchor_1672_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a> too, called “peplis,” not much
superior in its virtues to the cultivated<a id="FNanchor_1673_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> kind, of which such
remarkable properties are mentioned. It neutralizes the effects,
it is said, of poisoned arrows, and the venom of the serpents
known as h&aelig;morrhois and prester;<a id="FNanchor_1674_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> taken with the food and
applied to the wound, it extracts the poison. The juice, too,
they say, taken in raisin wine, is an antidote for henbane.
When the plant itself cannot be procured, the seed of it is
found to be equally efficacious. It is a corrective, also, of impurities
in water; and beaten up in wine and applied topically,
it is a cure for head-ache and ulcers of the head. Chewed in
combination with honey, it is curative of other kinds of sores.
It is similarly applied to the region of the brain in infants, and
in cases of umbilical hernia; as also for defluxions of the eyes,
in persons of all ages, being applied to the forehead and temples
with polenta. If employed as a liniment for the eyes,
milk and honey are added, and when used for proptosis<a id="FNanchor_1675_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the eyes, the leaves are beaten up with bean-shells. In combination
with, polenta, salt, and vinegar, it is employed as a
fomentation for blisters.</p>

<p>Chewed raw, purslain reduces ulcerations of the mouth and
gum-boils, and cures tooth-ache; a decoction of it is good, too,
for ulcers of the tonsils. Some persons have added a little
myrrh to it, when so employed. Chewed, it strengthens such
teeth as may happen to be loose, dispels crudities, imparts additional
strength to the voice, and allays thirst. Used with nut-galls,
linseed, and honey, in equal proportions, it assuages pains
in the neck; and, combined with honey or Cimolian<a id="FNanchor_1676_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> chalk, it is
good for diseases of the mamill&aelig;. The seed of it, taken with
honey, is beneficial for asthma. Eaten in salads,<a id="FNanchor_1677_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> this plant
is very strengthening to the stomach. In burning fevers, applications
of it are made with polenta; in addition to which,
if chewed, it will cool and refresh the intestines. It arrests
vomiting, also, and for dysentery and abscesses, it is eaten with
vinegar, or else taken with cummin in drink: boiled, it is good
for tenesmus. Taken either in the food or drink, it is good for
epilepsy; and, taken in doses of one acetabulum in boiled
wine,<a id="FNanchor_1678_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a> it promotes the menstrual discharge. Employed, also,
as a liniment with salt, it is used as a remedy for fits of hot
gout and erysipelas.</p>

<p>The juice of this plant, taken in drink, strengthens the kidneys
and bladder, and expels intestinal worms. In conjunction
with oil, it is applied, with polenta, to assuage the pain
of wounds, and it softens indurations of the sinews. Metrodorus,
who wrote an Abridgment of Botany,<a id="FNanchor_1679_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> says that it should
be given after delivery, to accelerate the lochial discharge. It
is also an antaphrodisiac, and prevents the recurrence of lascivious
dreams. One of the principal personages of Spain,
whose son has been Pr&aelig;tor, is in the habit of carrying the root
of it, to my knowledge, suspended by a string from his neck,
except when he is taking the bath, for an incurable affection
of the uvula; a precaution by which he has been spared all
inconvenience.</p>

<p>I have found it stated, too, in some authors, that if the head
is rubbed with a liniment of this plant, there will be no defluxions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
perceptible the whole year through. It is generally
thought, however, that purslain weakens the sight.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_82"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 82.—CORIANDER: TWENTY-ONE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is no wild coriander<a id="FNanchor_1680_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> to be found; the best, it is
generally agreed, is that of Egypt. Taken in drink and applied
to the wound, it is a remedy for the sting<a id="FNanchor_1681_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a> of one kind
of serpent, known as the amphisb&aelig;na:<a id="FNanchor_1682_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a> pounded, it is healing
also for other wounds, as well as for epinyctis and blisters.
Employed in the same state with honey or raisins, it disperses
all tumours and gatherings, and, beaten up in vinegar, it removes
abscesses of an inflammatory nature. Some persons
recommend three grains of it to be taken for tertian fevers, just
before the fit comes on, or else in larger quantities, to be bruised
and applied to the forehead. There are others, again, who
think that it is attended with excellent results, to put coriander
under the pillow before sunrise.</p>

<p>While green, it is possessed of very cooling and refreshing
properties. Combined with honey or raisins, it is an excellent
remedy for spreading ulcers, as also for diseases of the testes,
burns, carbuncles, and maladies of the ears. Applied with
woman’s milk, it is good for defluxions of the eyes; and for
fluxes of the belly and intestines, the seed is taken with water
in drink; it is also taken in drink for cholera, with rue.
Coriander seed, used as a potion with pomegranate juice and
oil, expels worms in the intestines.</p>

<p>Xenocrates states a very marvellous fact, if true; he says,
that if a woman takes one grain of this seed, the menstrual
discharge will be retarded one day, if two grains, two days,
and so on, according to the number of grains taken. Marcus
Varro is of opinion, that if coriander is lightly pounded, and
sprinkled over it with cummin and vinegar, all kinds of meat
may be kept in summer without spoiling.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_83"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 83.—ORAGE: FOURTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Orage,<a id="FNanchor_1683_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1683_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a> again, is found both wild and cultivated. Pythagoras<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
has accused this plant of producing dropsy, jaundice, and
paleness of the complexion, and he says that it is extremely
difficult of digestion. He asserts, also, to its disparagement,
that every thing that grows near it in the garden is sure to
be drooping and languid. Diocles and Dionysius have added
a statement, that it gives birth to numerous diseases, and that it
should never be boiled without changing the water repeatedly;
they say, too, that it is prejudicial to the stomach, and that
it is productive of freckles and pimples on the skin.</p>

<p>I am at a loss to imagine why Solo of Smyrna has stated that
this plant is cultivated in Italy with the greatest difficulty.
Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_1684_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a> prescribes it with beet, as a pessary for affections
of the uterus; and Lycus of Neapolis recommends it to
be taken in drink, in cases of poisoning by cantharides. He
is of opinion, also, that either raw or boiled, it may be advantageously
employed as a liniment for inflammatory swellings,
incipient boils, and all kinds of indurations; and that, mixed
with oxymel and nitre, it is good for erysipelas and gout. This
plant, it is said, will bring away mal-formed nails, without
producing sores. There are some persons who give orage-seed
with honey for jaundice, and rub the throat and tonsils with
it, nitre being added as well. They employ it, also, to purge
the bowels, and use the seed, boiled, as an emetic,<a id="FNanchor_1685_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> either taken
by itself, or in conjunction with mallows or lentils.</p>

<p>Wild orage is used for dyeing the hair, as well as the other
purposes above enumerated.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_84"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 84. (21.)—THE MALLOW CALLED MALOPE: THIRTEEN REMEDIES.
THE MALLOW CALLED MALACHE: ONE REMEDY. THE
MALLOW CALLED ALTH&AElig;A, OR PLISTOLOCHIA: FIFTY-NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Both kinds of mallows,<a id="FNanchor_1686_1686"></a><a href="#Footnote_1686_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> on the other hand, the cultivated
and the wild, are held in very general esteem. These kinds
are subdivided, each of them, into two varieties, according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the size of the leaf. The cultivated mallow with large leaves
is known to the Greeks by the name of “malope,”<a id="FNanchor_1687_1687"></a><a href="#Footnote_1687_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> the other
being called “malache,”<a id="FNanchor_1688_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a>—from the circumstance, it is generally
thought, that it relaxes<a id="FNanchor_1689_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a> the bowels. The wild<a id="FNanchor_1690_1690"></a><a href="#Footnote_1690_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a> mallow,
again, with large leaves and white roots, is called “alth&aelig;a,”
and by some persons, on account of its salutary properties,
“plistolochia.”<a id="FNanchor_1691_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_1691_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a> Every soil in which mallows are sown, is
rendered all the richer thereby. This plant is possessed of remarkable
virtues,<a id="FNanchor_1692_1692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1692_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> as a cure for all kinds of stings,<a id="FNanchor_1693_1693"></a><a href="#Footnote_1693_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a> those of
scorpions, wasps, and similar insects, as well as the bite of the
shrew-mouse, more particularly; nay, what is even more than
this, if a person has been rubbed with oil in which any one of
the mallows has been beaten up, or even if he carries them on
his person, he will never be stung. A leaf of mallow put upon
a scorpion, will strike it with torpor.</p>

<p>The mallow is an antidote, also, against the poisonous effects
of white<a id="FNanchor_1694_1694"></a><a href="#Footnote_1694_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a> lead; and applied raw with saltpetre, it extracts
all kinds of pointed bodies from the flesh. A decoction of it
with the root, taken in drink, neutralizes the poison of the
sea-hare,<a id="FNanchor_1695_1695"></a><a href="#Footnote_1695_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a> provided, as some say, it is brought off the stomach
by vomiting.</p>

<p>Other marvels are also related in connection with the mallow,
but the most surprising thing of all is, that if a person takes
half a cyathus of the juice of any one of them daily, he will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
exempt from all diseases.<a id="FNanchor_1696_1696"></a><a href="#Footnote_1696_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a> Left to putrefy in wine, mallows are
remedial for running sores of the head, and, mixed with honey,
for lichens and ulcerations of the mouth; a decoction of the root,
too, is a remedy for dandriff<a id="FNanchor_1697_1697"></a><a href="#Footnote_1697_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> of the head and looseness of the
teeth. With the root of the mallow which has a single stem,<a id="FNanchor_1698_1698"></a><a href="#Footnote_1698_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a>
it is a good plan to prick the parts about a tooth when it aches,
until the pain has ceased. With the addition of human saliva,
the mallow cleanses scrofulous sores, imposthumes of the parotid
glands, and inflammatory tumours, without producing a wound.
The seed of it, taken in red wine, disperses phlegm and relieves
nausea; and the root, attached to the person with black wool,
is a remedy for affections of the mamill&aelig;. Boiled in milk, and
taken as a pottage, it cures a cough within five days.</p>

<p>Sextius Niger says that mallows are prejudicial to the stomach,
and Olympias, the Theban authoress, asserts that, employed
with goose-grease, they are productive of abortion.
Some persons are of opinion, that a good handful of the leaves,
taken in oil and wine, promotes the menstrual discharge. At
all events, it is a well-known fact, that if the leaves are strewed
beneath a woman in labour, the delivery will be accelerated;
but they must be taken away immediately after the birth, or
prolapsus of the uterus will be the consequence. Mallow-juice,
also, is given to women in labour, a decoction of it being taken
fasting in wine, in doses of one hemina.</p>

<p>Mallow seed is attached to the arms of patients suffering
from spermatorrhœa; and, so naturally adapted is this plant
for the promotion of lustfulness, that the seed of the kind with
a single stem, sprinkled upon the genitals, will increase the
sexual desire in males to an infinite degree, according to
Xenocrates; who says, too, that if three roots are attached to
the person, in the vicinity of those parts, they will be productive
of a similar result. The same writer informs us also, that
injections of mallows are good for tenesmus and dysentery, and
for maladies of the rectum even, if used as a fomentation
only. The juice is given warm to patients afflicted with melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
in doses of three cyathi, and to insane persons<a id="FNanchor_1699_1699"></a><a href="#Footnote_1699_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> in doses
of four. One hemina of the decoction is prescribed, also, for
epilepsy.<a id="FNanchor_1700_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_1700_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> A warm decoction of the juice is employed, too, as
a fomentation for calculus, flatulency, gripings of the stomach,
and opisthotony. The leaves are boiled, and applied with oil,
as a poultice for erysipelas and burns, and raw, with bread, to
arrest inflammation in wounds. A decoction of mallows is
beneficial for affections of the sinews and bladder, and for
gnawing pains of the intestines; taken, too, as an aliment, or
an injection, they are relaxing to the uterus, and the decoction,
taken with oil, facilitates the passage of the urine.<a id="FNanchor_1701_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a></p>

<p>The root of the alth&aelig;a<a id="FNanchor_1702_1702"></a><a href="#Footnote_1702_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> is even more efficacious for all the
purposes above enumerated, and for convulsions and ruptures
more particularly. Boiled in water, it arrests looseness of the
bowels; and taken in white wine, it is a cure for scrofulous
sores, imposthumes of the parotid glands, and inflammations of
the mamill&aelig;. A decoction of the leaves in wine, applied as a
liniment, disperses inflammatory tumours; and the leaves, first
dried, and then boiled in milk, are a speedy cure for a cough,
however inveterate. Hippocrates prescribes a decoction of the
root to be drunk by persons wounded or thirsty from loss of
blood, and the plant itself as an application to wounds, with
honey and resin. He also recommends it to be employed in a
similar manner for contusions, sprains, and tumours of the
muscles, sinews, and joints, and prescribes it to be taken in
wine for asthma and dysentery. It is a singular thing, that
water in which this root has been put, thickens when exposed

<p>Lapathum, too, has pretty nearly the same properties.
There is a wild<a id="FNanchor_1705_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a> variety, known to some as “oxalis,”
very similar in taste to the cultivated kind, with pointed

diminutive root: our people call it “rumex,”<a id="FNanchor_1706_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> while others,

a distinct variety, known as “oxylapathon,”<a id="FNanchor_1708_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> which resembles
the cultivated kind even more than the last, though the
leaves are more pointed and redder: it grows only in marshy
spots. Some authors are found who speak of a “hydrolapathon,”<a id="FNanchor_1709_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a>
which grows in the water, they say. There is also
another variety, known as “hippolapathon,”<a id="FNanchor_1710_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> larger than the
cultivated kind, whiter, and more compact.</p>

<p>The wild varieties of the lapathum are a cure<a id="FNanchor_1711_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> for the

<p>As to garden lapathum,<a id="FNanchor_1715_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> it is good in liniments on the
forehead for defluxions of the eyes. The root of it cures
lichens and leprous sores, and a decoction of it in wine is
remedial for scrofulous swellings, imposthumes of the parotid
glands, and calculus of the bladder. Taken in wine it is a
cure for affections of the spleen, and employed as a fomentation,
it is equally good for cœliac affections, dysentery, and
tenesmus. For all these purposes, the juice of lapathum is
found to be even still more efficacious. It acts as a carminative
and diuretic, and dispels films on the eyes: put
into the bath, or else rubbed upon the body, without oil,
before taking the bath, it effectually removes all itching sensations.
The root of it, chewed, strengthens the teeth, and a
decoction of it in wine arrests<a id="FNanchor_1716_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a> looseness of the stomach:

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_87"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 87. (22.)—MUSTARD, THE THREE KINDS OF IT: FORTY-FOUR
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Mustard, of which we have mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1718_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a> three different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
kinds, when speaking of the garden herbs, is ranked by Pythagoras
among the very first of those plants the pungency of
which mounts upwards; for there is none to be found more
penetrating to the brain and nostrils.</p>

<p>Pounded with vinegar, mustard is employed as a liniment
for the stings of serpents and scorpions, and it effectually neutralizes
the poisonous properties of fungi. To cure an immoderate
secretion of phlegm it is kept in the mouth till it melts,
or else it is mixed with hydromel, and employed as a gargle.
Mustard is chewed for tooth-ache, and is taken as a gargle
with oxymel for affections of the uvula; it is very beneficial,
also, for all maladies of the stomach. Taken with the food, it
facilitates expectoration<a id="FNanchor_1719_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> from the lungs: it is given, too, for
asthma and epileptic fits, in combination with cucumber seed.
It has the effect of quickening the senses, and effectually
clears the head by sneezing, relaxes the stomach, and promotes
the menstrual discharge and the urinary secretions: beaten up
with figs and cummin, in the proportion of one-third of each
ingredient, it is used as an external application for dropsy.</p>

<p>Mixed with vinegar, mustard resuscitates by its powerful
odour persons who have swooned in fits of epilepsy or
lethargy, as well as females suffering from hysterical suffocations.
For the cure of lethargy tordylon is added—that being
the name given to the seed of hartwort<a id="FNanchor_1720_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a>—and if the lethargic
sleep should happen to be very profound, an application
of it, with figs and vinegar, is made to the legs, or to the
head<a id="FNanchor_1721_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> even. Used as an external application, mustard is a
cure for inveterate pains of the chest, loins, hips, shoulders,
and, in general, for all deep-seated pains in any part of the
body, raising blisters<a id="FNanchor_1722_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> by its caustic properties. In cases of
extreme indurations of the skin, the mustard is applied, to the
part without figs; and a cloth is employed doubled, where it is
apprehended that it may burn too powerfully. It is used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
also, combined with red-earth,<a id="FNanchor_1723_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> for alopecy, itch-scabs, leprosy,
phthiriasis, tetanus, and opisthotony. They employ
it also as a liniment with honey for styes<a id="FNanchor_1724_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> on the eyelids
and films on the eyes.</p>

<p>The juices of mustard are extracted in three different
ways, in earthen vessels in which it is left to dry gradually
in the sun. From the thin stem of the plant there exudes
also a milky juice,<a id="FNanchor_1725_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> which when thus hardened is remedial
for tooth-ache. The seed and root, after they have been left
to steep in must, are beaten up together in a mortar; and a
good handful of the mixture is taken to strengthen<a id="FNanchor_1726_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> the
throat, stomach, eyes, head, and all the senses. This mixture
is extremely good, too, for fits of lassitude in females, being
one of the most wholesome medicines in existence. Taken in
vinegar, mustard disperses calculi in the bladder; and, in combination
with honey and goose-grease, or else Cyprian wax,
it is employed as a liniment for livid spots and bruises. From
the seed, first steeped in olive-oil, and then subjected to
pressure, an oil is extracted, which is employed for rigidity
of the sinews, and chills and numbness in the loins and hips.</p>

mention<a id="FNanchor_1727_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a> when speaking of the forest-trees, has a similar
nature<a id="FNanchor_1728_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> to that of mustard, and is productive of the same
effects: it grows upon the outer coat of reeds, below the head.</p>

PHILOPAIS, OR PHILOCHARES: TWENTY-NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Most medical writers have spoken in high terms of marrubium,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
or horehound, as a plant of the very greatest utility.
Among the Greeks, it is called “prasion”<a id="FNanchor_1729_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> by some, by
others “linostrophon,”<a id="FNanchor_1730_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> and by others, again, “philopais”<a id="FNanchor_1731_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> or
“philochares:”<a id="FNanchor_1732_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a> it is a plant too well known to require any
description.<a id="FNanchor_1733_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a> The leaves<a id="FNanchor_1734_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> and seed beaten up, together, are
good for the stings of serpents, pains of the chest and side,
and inveterate coughs. The branches, too, boiled in water
with panic,<a id="FNanchor_1735_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a> so as to modify its acridity, are remarkably useful
for persons troubled with spitting<a id="FNanchor_1736_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> of blood. Horehound is
applied also, with grease, to scrofulous swellings. Some
persons recommend for a cough, a pinch of the fresh seed with
two fingers, boiled with a handful of spelt<a id="FNanchor_1737_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> and a little oil
and salt, the mixture to be taken fasting. Others, again, regard
as quite incomparable for a similar purpose an extract of the
juices of horehound and fennel. Taking three sextarii of the
extract, they boil it down to two, and then add one sextarius
of honey; after which they again boil it down to two, and
administer one spoonful of the preparation daily, in one cyathus
of water.</p>

<p>Beaten up with honey, horehound is particularly beneficial
for affections of the male organs; employed with vinegar, it
cleanses lichens, and is very salutary for ruptures, convulsions,
spasms, and contractions of the sinews. Taken in drink
with salt and vinegar, it relaxes the bowels, promotes the
menstrual discharge, and accelerates the after-birth. Dried,
powdered, and taken with honey, it is extremely efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
for a dry cough, as also for gangrenes and hang-nails.<a id="FNanchor_1738_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> The
juice, too, taken with honey, is good for the ears and nostrils:
it is a remedy also for jaundice, and diminishes the
bilious secretions. Among the few antidotes<a id="FNanchor_1739_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> for poisons, it
is one of the very best known.</p>

<p>The plant itself, taken with iris and honey, purges the stomach
and promotes expectorations: it acts, also, as a strong
diuretic, though, at the same time, care must be taken not to
use it when the bladder is ulcerated and the kidneys are affected.
It is said, too, that the juice of horehound improves
the eyesight. Castor speaks of two varieties of it, the black
horehound and the white, which last he considers to be the
best. He puts the juice of it into an empty eggshell, and then
mixes the egg with it, together with honey, in equal proportions:
this preparation used warm, he says, will bring
abscesses to a head, and cleanse and heal them. Beaten up,
too, with stale axle-grease and applied topically, he says, horehound
is a cure for the bite of a dog.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_90"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 90.—WILD THYME: EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Wild thyme, it is said, borrows its name, “serpyllum,” from
the fact that it is a creeping<a id="FNanchor_1740_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a> plant, a property peculiar to the
wild kind, that which grows in rocky places more particularly.
The cultivated<a id="FNanchor_1741_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> thyme is not a creeping plant, but grows upwards,
as much a palm in height. That which springs up
spontaneously, grows the most luxuriantly, its leaves and
branches being whiter than those of the other kinds. Thyme
is efficacious as a remedy for the stings of serpents, the cenchris<a id="FNanchor_1742_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a>
more particularly; also for the sting of the scolopendra,
both sea and land, the leaves and branches being boiled for the
purpose in wine. Burnt, it puts to flight all venomous creatures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
by its smell, and it is particularly beneficial as an antidote
to the venom of marine animals.</p>

<p>A decoction of it in vinegar is applied for head-ache, with
rose oil, to the temples and forehead, as also for phrenitis and
lethargy: it is given, too, in doses of four drachm&aelig;, for gripings
of the stomach, strangury, quinsy, and fits of vomiting.
It is taken in water, also, for liver complaints. The leaves are
given in doses of four oboli, in vinegar, for diseases of the
spleen. Beaten up in two cyathi of oxymel, it is used for
spitting of blood.</p>

<p>Wild<a id="FNanchor_1743_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> sisymbrium, by some persons called “thymbr&aelig;um,”
does not grow beyond a foot in height. The kind<a id="FNanchor_1744_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> which
grows in watery places, is similar to nasturtium, and they<a id="FNanchor_1745_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a>
are both of them efficacious for the stings of certain insects,
such as hornets and the like. That which grows in dry localities
is odoriferous, and is employed<a id="FNanchor_1746_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> for wreaths: the leaf
of it is narrower than in the other kind. They both of them
alleviate head-ache, and defluxions of the eyes, Philinus says.
Some persons, however, employ bread in addition; while
others, again, use a decoction of the plant by itself in wine.
It is a cure, also, for epinyctis, and removes spots on the face
in females, by the end of four days; for which purpose, it is
applied at night and taken off in the day-time. It arrests
vomiting, hiccup, gripings, and fluxes of the stomach, whether
taken with the food, or the juice extracted and given in drink.</p>

<p>This plant, however, should never be eaten by pregnant
women, except in cases where the fœtus is dead, for the very
application of it is sufficient to produce abortion. Taken with
wine, it is diuretic, and the wild variety expels calculi even.
For persons necessitated to sit up awake, an infusion of it in
vinegar is applied as a liniment to the head.</p>

but, employed by itself, it disperses spots on the face
in women: its juice, too, is very beneficial to the sight.
Combined with incense and water, or else with myrrh and
wine, it is a cure for defluxions of the eyes, and employed
with honey, grease, or wax, for imposthumes of the parotid
glands. Prepared<a id="FNanchor_1748_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a> like polenta, it is good for fluxes of the
stomach; and a decoction of it in water and oil, applied topically
with anise, is prescribed for quinsy. It is sometimes
used parched, also, to arrest looseness of the bowels, and applications
of it are used, with vinegar, for cœliac affections
and dysentery. It is eaten with raisins, also, for pains in the
liver, and excellent electuaries are made of it for the treatment
of phthisis.</p>

<p>Linseed-meal, with the addition of nitre, salt, or ashes,
softens rigidities of the muscles, sinews, joints, and vertebr&aelig;,
as well as of the membranous tissues of the brain. Employed
with figs, linseed-meal ripens abscesses and brings them
to a head: mixed with the root of wild cucumber, it extracts<a id="FNanchor_1749_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a>
all foreign bodies from the flesh, as well as splinters of broken
bones. A decoction of linseed-meal in wine prevents ulcers from
spreading, and mixed with honey, it is remedial for pituitous
eruptions. Used with nasturtium, in equal quantities, it
rectifies<a id="FNanchor_1750_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> malformed nails; mixed with resin and myrrh, it
cures affections of the testes and hernia,<a id="FNanchor_1751_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> and with water,
gangrenous sores. A decoction of linseed-meal with fenugreek,
in the proportion of one sextarius of each, in hydromel,
is recommended for pains in the stomach; and employed as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>

by way of<a id="FNanchor_1753_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_1753_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a> reproach. It is<a id="FNanchor_1754_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> prejudicial to the stomach, and
disturbs the bowels to such a degree, as to cause cholera in
some. It is stated, however, that, taken in wine, it is good
for the stings of scorpions; and that it is sometimes used as a
liniment for corns on the feet, and, with oil, for affections of
the spleen and pains in the temples. Hippocrates is of opinion,
that if taken with the food,<a id="FNanchor_1755_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_1755_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> it will arrest the menstrual

<p>The root of this plant, pounded or boiled, and taken in water,

it has a larger leaf and a more acrid taste than the other kind.
It is taller, also, about the thickness of a walking-stick, and
has a white root: it grows in warm, but stony localities.
Diocles speaks, too, of another<a id="FNanchor_1761_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_1761_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a> variety of hippomarathron,
with a long narrow leaf, and a seed like that of coriander.</p>

<p>The seed of the cultivated fennel is medicinally employed in
wine, for the stings of scorpions and serpents, and the juice of
it, injected into the ears, has the effect of destroying small
worms that breed there. Fennel is employed as an ingredient
in nearly all our seasonings,<a id="FNanchor_1762_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> vinegar<a id="FNanchor_1763_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> sauces more particularly:
it is placed also beneath the undercrust of bread. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
seed, in fevers even, acts as an astringent upon a relaxed stomach,
and beaten up with water, it allays nausea: it is highly
esteemed, also, for affections of the lungs and liver. Taken
in moderate quantities, it arrests looseness of the bowels, and
acts as a diuretic; a decoction of it is good for gripings of the
stomach, and taken in drink, it restores the milk. The root,
taken in a ptisan,<a id="FNanchor_1764_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1764_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a> purges the kidneys—an effect which is
equally produced by a decoction of the juice or of the seed; the
root is good too, boiled in wine, for dropsy and convulsions.
The leaves are applied to burning tumours, with vinegar,
expel calculi of the bladder, and act as an aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>In whatever way it is taken in drink, fennel has the property
of promoting the secretion of the seminal fluids; and it
is extremely beneficial to the generative organs, whether a decoction
of the root in wine is employed as a fomentation, or
whether it is used beaten up in oil. Many persons apply
fennel with wax to tumours and bruises, and employ the root,
with the juice of the plant, or else with honey, for the bites of
dogs, and with wine for the stings of multipedes.</p>

<p>Hippomarathron is more efficacious, in every respect, than
cultivated fennel;<a id="FNanchor_1765_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_1765_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> it expels calculi more particularly, and,
taken with weak wine, is good for the bladder and irregularities
of the menstrual discharge.</p>

<p>In this plant, the seed is more efficacious than the root;
the dose of either of them being a pinch with two fingers,
beaten up, and mixed with the usual drink. Petrichus, who
wrote a work “On Serpents,”<a id="FNanchor_1766_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_1766_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a> and Micton, who wrote a treatise
“On<a id="FNanchor_1767_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_1767_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> Botany,” are of opinion that there is nothing in
existence of greater efficacy against serpents than hippomarathron:
indeed, Nicander<a id="FNanchor_1768_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> has ranked it by no means among
the lowest of antidotes.</p>

Hempseed,<a id="FNanchor_1771_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_1771_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> it is said, renders men impotent: the juice of
this seed will extract worms from the ears, or any insect
which may have entered them, though at the cost of producing
head-ache. The virtues of hemp, it is said, are so great, that
an infusion of it in water will cause it to coagulate:<a id="FNanchor_1772_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_1772_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> hence it
is, that if taken in water, it will arrest looseness in beasts of
burden. A decoction of the root in water, relaxes contractions
of the joints, and cures gout and similar maladies. It is applied
raw to burns, but it must be frequently changed, so as
not to let it dry.</p>

<p>Fennel-giant<a id="FNanchor_1773_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> has a seed similar to that of dill. That
which has a single stem, bifurcated<a id="FNanchor_1774_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> at the top, is generally
thought to be the female plant. The stalks of it are eaten
boiled;<a id="FNanchor_1775_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a> and, pickled in brine and honey, they are recommended
as particularly beneficial to the stomach;<a id="FNanchor_1776_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a> if taken,
however, in too large quantities, they are apt to produce
head-ache. The root of it in doses of one denarius to two
cyathi of wine, is used in drink for the stings of serpents, and
the root itself is applied topically for the same purpose, as
also for the cure of gripings of the stomach. Taken in oil
and vinegar, it is used as a check for excessive perspirations,
in fevers even. The inspissated juice of fennel-giant, taken
in quantities the size of a bean, acts as a purgative;<a id="FNanchor_1777_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a> and the
pith<a id="FNanchor_1778_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a> of it is good for the uterus, as well as all the maladies
previously mentioned. To arrest h&aelig;morrhage, ten of the
seeds are taken in drink, bruised in wine, or else with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
pith of the plant. There are some persons who think that
the seed should be administered for epilepsy, from the fourth
to the seventh day of the moon, in doses of one spoonful.</p>

<p>Fennel-giant is naturally so inimical to the mur&aelig;na, that
the very touch of it even will kill that fish. Castor was of
opinion that the juice of the root is extremely beneficial to
the sight.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XX_CHAP_99"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 99.—THE THISTLE OR SCOLYMOS: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_1779_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_1779_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a> spoken, when treating of the garden
plants, of the cultivation of the thistle; we may as well,
therefore, not delay to mention its medicinal properties. Of
wild thistles there are two varieties; one<a id="FNanchor_1780_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_1780_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a> of which throws
out numerous stalks immediately it leaves the ground, the
other<a id="FNanchor_1781_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a> being thicker, and having but a single stem. They
have, both of them, a few leaves only, and covered with
prickles, the head of the plant being protected by thorny
points: the last mentioned, however, puts forth in the middle
of these points a purple blossom, which turns white with
great rapidity, and is carried off by the wind; the Greeks
give it the name of “scolymos.”</p>

<p>This plant, gathered before it blossoms, and beaten up and
subjected to pressure, produces a juice, which, applied to the
head, makes the hair grow again when it has fallen off through
alopecy. The root of either kind, boiled in water, creates
thirst, it is said, in those who drink it. It strengthens the
stomach also, and if we are to believe what is said, has some
influence upon the womb in promoting the conception of male
offspring: at all events, Glaucias, who seems to have paid
the most attention to the subject, has written to that effect.
The thin juice, like mastich, which exudes from these plants,
imparts sweetness to the breath.</p>

extracted from them as an antidote against the stings of all

<p>Take two denarii of wild thyme, and the same quantity of
opopanax and meum respectively; one denarius of trefoil
seed; and of aniseed, fennel-seed, ammi, and parsley, six
denarii respectively, with twelve denarii of meal of fitches.
Heat up these ingredients together, and pass them through a
sieve; after which they must be kneaded with the best wine
that can be had, and then made into lozenges of one victoriatus<a id="FNanchor_1783_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_1783_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a>

CHAPLETS MORE PARTICULARLY.</span></h2></div>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)—THE NATURE OF FLOWERS AND GARLANDS.</span></h3>

<p>Cato has recommended that flowers for making chaplets
should also be cultivated in the garden; varieties remarkable
for a delicacy which it is quite impossible to express, inasmuch
as no individual can find such facilities for describing
them as Nature does for bestowing on them their numerous tints—Nature,
who here in especial shows herself in a sportive
mood, and takes a delight in the prolific display of her varied
productions. The other<a id="FNanchor_1837_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a> plants she has produced for our use
and our nutriment, and to them accordingly she has granted
years and even ages of duration: but as for the flowers and
their perfumes, she has given them birth for but a day—a
mighty lesson to man, we see, to teach him that that which in
its career is the most beauteous and the most attractive to the
eye, is the very first to fade and die.</p>

<p>Even the limner’s art itself possesses no resources for reproducing
the colours of the flowers in all their varied tints
and combinations, whether we view them in groups alternately
blending their hues, or whether arranged in festoons, each
variety by<a id="FNanchor_1838_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> itself, now assuming a circular form, now running
obliquely, and now disposed in a spiral pattern; or whether,
as we see sometimes, one wreath is interwoven within another.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2. (2.)—GARLANDS AND CHAPLETS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The ancients used chaplets of diminutive size, called
“struppi;”<a id="FNanchor_1839_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> from which comes our name for a chaplet, “strophiolum.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Indeed, it was only by very slow degrees that
this last word<a id="FNanchor_1840_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> became generalized, as the chaplets that were
used at sacrifices, or were granted as the reward of military
valour, asserted their exclusive right to the name of “corona.”
As for garlands, when they came to be made of flowers, they
received the name of “serta,” from the verb “sero,”<a id="FNanchor_1841_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a> or
else from our word “series.”<a id="FNanchor_1842_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> The use<a id="FNanchor_1843_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a> of flowers for garlands
is not so very ancient, among the Greeks even.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 3.—WHO INVENTED THE ART OF MAKING GARLANDS:
WHEN THEY FIRST RECEIVED THE NAME OF “COROLL&AElig;,” AND
FOR WHAT REASON.</span></h3></div>

<p>For in early times it was the usage to crown the victors in
the sacred contests with branches of trees: and it was only
at a later period, that they began to vary their tints by the
combination<a id="FNanchor_1844_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a> of flowers, to heighten the effect in turn by their
colour and their smell—an invention due to the ingenuity of
the painter Pausias, at Sicyon,<a id="FNanchor_1845_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> and the garland-maker Glycera,
a female to whom he was greatly attached, and whose
handiwork was imitated by him in colours. Challenging him
to a trial of skill, she would repeatedly vary her designs, and
thus it was in reality a contest between art and Nature; a fact
which we find attested by pictures of that artist even still in
existence, more particularly the one known as the “Stephaneplocos,”<a id="FNanchor_1846_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a>
in which he has given a likeness of Glycera herself.
This invention, therefore, is only to be traced to later than the
Hundredth<a id="FNanchor_1847_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> Olympiad.</p>

<p>Chaplets of flowers being now the fashion, it was not long
before those came into vogue which are known to us as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Egyptian<a id="FNanchor_1848_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> chaplets; and then the winter chaplets, made for
the time at which Earth refuses her flowers, of thin lamin&aelig; of
horn stained various colours. By slow degrees, too, the name
was introduced at Rome, these garlands being known there
at first as “coroll&aelig;,” a designation given them to express
the remarkable delicacy<a id="FNanchor_1849_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> of their texture. In more recent
times, again, when the chaplets presented were made of thin
plates<a id="FNanchor_1850_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a> of copper, gilt or silvered, they assumed the name
of “corollaria.”</p>

<p>Crassus Dives<a id="FNanchor_1851_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_1851_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a> was the first who gave chaplets with artificial
leaves of silver and gold, at the games celebrated by him.
To embellish these chaplets, and to confer additional honour
on them, lemnisci were added, in imitation of the Etruscan
chaplets, which ought properly to have none but lemnisci<a id="FNanchor_1852_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_1852_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a>
made of gold. For a long period these lemnisci were destitute
of ornament:<a id="FNanchor_1853_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> P. Claudius Pulcher<a id="FNanchor_1854_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> was the first who
taught us to emboss<a id="FNanchor_1855_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> them, and added leaves of tinsel to the
lamin&aelig;<a id="FNanchor_1856_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a> of which the lemniscus was formed.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 5.—THE GREAT HONOUR IN WHICH CHAPLETS WERE HELD
BY THE ANCIENTS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Chaplets, however, were always held in a high degree of
estimation, those even which were acquired at the public
games. For it was the usage of the citizens to go down in
person to take part in the contests of the Circus, and to
send their slaves and horses thither as well. Hence it is that
we find it thus written in the laws of the Twelve Tables:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
“If any person has gained a chaplet himself, or by his
money,<a id="FNanchor_1857_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> let the same be given to him as the reward of his
prowess.” There is no doubt that by the words “gained by
his money,” the laws meant a chaplet which had been gained
by his slaves or horses. Well then, what was the honour acquired
thereby? It was the right secured by the victor, for
himself and for his parents, after death, to be crowned without
fail, while the body was laid out in the house,<a id="FNanchor_1858_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a> and on its
being carried<a id="FNanchor_1859_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> to the tomb.</p>

<p>On other occasions, chaplets were not indiscriminately
worn, not even those which had been won in the games.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 6.—THE SEVERITY OF THE ANCIENTS IN REFERENCE TO
CHAPLETS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Indeed the rules upon this point were remarkably severe.
L. Fulvius, a banker,<a id="FNanchor_1860_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a> having been accused, at the time of
the Second Punic War, of looking down from the balcony<a id="FNanchor_1861_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a>
of his house upon the Forum, with a chaplet of roses upon
his head, was imprisoned by order of the Senate, and was not
liberated before the war was brought to a close. P. Munatius,
having placed upon his head a chaplet of flowers taken
from the statue of Marsyas,<a id="FNanchor_1862_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> was condemned by the Triumviri
to be put in chains. Upon his making appeal to the
tribunes of the people, they refused to intercede in his behalf—a
very different state of things to that at Athens, where
the young men,<a id="FNanchor_1863_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> in their drunken revelry, were in the habit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
before midday, of making their way into the very schools of
the philosophers even. Among ourselves, no such instance of
a similar licentiousness is to be found, unless, indeed, in the
case of the daughter<a id="FNanchor_1864_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> of the late Emperor Augustus, who, in
her nocturnal debaucheries, placed a chaplet on the statue<a id="FNanchor_1865_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a>
of Marsyas, conduct deeply deplored in the letters of that

<p>Scipio is the only person that ever received from the Roman

Scipio received the surname of Serapio,<a id="FNanchor_1867_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> from his remarkable
resemblance to a certain person of that name who dealt in
pigs. He died in his tribuneship, greatly beloved by the
people, and in every way worthy of the family of the Africani.
The property he left was not sufficient to pay the expenses of
his burial; upon which the people made a subscription and
contracted<a id="FNanchor_1868_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> for his funeral, flowers being scattered upon the

<p>In those days, too, chaplets were employed in honour of the

was held by the plaited chaplet; such as we find used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
by the Salii in their sacred rites, and at the solemnization of
their yearly<a id="FNanchor_1871_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> banquets. In later times, the rose chaplet has
been adopted, and luxury arose at last to such a pitch that a
chaplet was held in no esteem at all if it did not consist entirely
of leaves sown together with the needle. More recently,
again, they have been imported from India, or from nations
beyond the countries of India.</p>

<p>But it is looked upon as the most refined of all, to present
chaplets made of nard leaves, or else of silk of many colours
steeped in unguents. Such is the pitch to which the luxuriousness
of our women has at last arrived!</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_9"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 9.—AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON FLOWERS. AN
ANECDOTE RELATIVE TO QUEEN CLEOPATRA AND CHAPLETS.
</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the Greeks, the physicians Mnesitheus and Callimachus
have written separate treatises on the subject of
chaplets, making mention of such flowers as are injurious to
the head.<a id="FNanchor_1872_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> For, in fact, the health is here concerned to some
extent, as it is at the moments of carousal and gaiety in particular
that penetrating odours steal insidiously upon the
brain—witness an instance in the wicked cunning displayed
upon one occasion by Cleopatra.</p>

<p>At the time when preparations were making for the battle
that was eventually fought at Actium, Antonius held the
queen in such extreme distrust as to be in dread of her very
attentions even, and would not so much as touch his food,
unless another person had tasted it first. Upon this, the
queen, it is said, wishing to amuse herself with his fears, had
the extremities of the flowers in a chaplet dipped in poison, and
then placed it upon her head.<a id="FNanchor_1873_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> After a time, as the hilarity
increased apace, she challenged Antonius to swallow the chaplets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
mixed up with their drink. Who, under such circumstances
as these, could have apprehended treachery? Accordingly,
the leaves were stripped from off the chaplet, and thrown into
the cup. Just as Antonius was on the very point of drinking,
she arrested his arm with her hand.—“Behold, Marcus Antonius,”
said she, “the woman against whom you are so careful
to take these new precautions of yours in employing your
tasters! And would then, if I could exist without you, either
means or opportunity of effecting my purpose be wanting to
me?” Saying this, she ordered a man to be brought from
prison, and made him drink off the potion; he did so, and
fell dead<a id="FNanchor_1874_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> upon the spot.</p>

<p>Besides the two authors above-mentioned, Theophrastus,<a id="FNanchor_1875_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a>
among the Greeks, has written on the subject of flowers.
Some of our own writers also have given the title of “Anthologica”
to their works, but no one, to my knowledge at least,
has treated expressly<a id="FNanchor_1876_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a> of flowers. In fact, we ourselves have
no intention here of discussing the mode of wearing chaplets,
for that would be frivolous<a id="FNanchor_1877_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> indeed; but shall proceed to
state such particulars in relation to flowers as shall appear to
us deserving of remark.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_10"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 10. (4.)—THE ROSE: TWELVE VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The people of our country were acquainted with but very
few garland flowers among the garden plants, and those few
hardly any but the violet and the rose. The plant which bears
the rose is, properly speaking, more of a thorn than a shrub—indeed,
we sometimes find it growing on a bramble<a id="FNanchor_1878_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> even;
the flower having, even then, a pleasant smell, though by no
means penetrating. The flower in all roses is originally enclosed
in a bud,<a id="FNanchor_1879_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a> with a grained surface within, which gradually
swells, and assumes the form of a green pointed cone,
similar to our alabaster<a id="FNanchor_1880_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> unguent boxes in shape. Gradually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
acquiring a ruddy tint, this bud opens little by little, until at
last it comes into full blow, developing the calyx, and embracing
the yellow-pointed filaments which stand erect in the
centre of it.</p>

<p>The employment of the rose in chaplets is, so to say, the
least<a id="FNanchor_1881_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a> use that is made of it. The flower is steeped in oil, a
practice which has prevailed from the times of the Trojan war,
as Homer<a id="FNanchor_1882_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> bears witness; in addition to which, it now forms
an ingredient in our unguents, as mentioned on a previous
occasion.<a id="FNanchor_1883_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> It is employed also by itself for certain medicinal
purposes, and is used in plasters and eye-salves<a id="FNanchor_1884_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a> for its penetrating
qualities: it is used, also, to perfume the delicacies of
our banquets, and is never attended with any noxious results.</p>

<p>The most esteemed kinds of rose among us are those of
Pr&aelig;neste<a id="FNanchor_1885_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> and Campania.<a id="FNanchor_1886_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a> Some persons have added to these
varieties the rose of Miletus,<a id="FNanchor_1887_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a> the flower of which is an extremely
brilliant red, and has never more than a dozen petals.
The next to it is the rose of Trachyn,<a id="FNanchor_1888_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> not so red as the last,
and then that of Alabanda,<a id="FNanchor_1889_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> with whitish petals, but not so
highly esteemed. The least esteemed of all, however, is the
thorn rose,<a id="FNanchor_1890_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a> the petals of which are numerous, but extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
small. The essential points of difference in the rose are the
number<a id="FNanchor_1891_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> of the petals, the comparative number<a id="FNanchor_1892_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> of thorns on
the stem, the colour, and the smell. The number of the petals,
which is never less than five, goes on increasing in amount,
till we find one variety with as many as a hundred, and
thence known as the “centifolia:”<a id="FNanchor_1893_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> in Italy, it is to be found
in Campania, and in Greece, in the vicinity of Philippi, though
this last is not the place of its natural<a id="FNanchor_1894_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> growth. Mount Pang&aelig;eus,<a id="FNanchor_1895_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a>
in the same vicinity, produces a rose with numerous
petals of diminutive size: the people of those parts are in the
habit of transplanting it, a method which greatly tends to improve
its growth. This kind, however, is not remarkable for
its smell, nor yet is the rose which has a very large or very
broad petal: indeed, we may state in a few words, that the
best proof of the perfume of the flower is the comparative
roughness of the calyx.<a id="FNanchor_1896_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a></p>

<p>C&aelig;pio, who lived in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, asserts
that the centifolia is never employed for chaplets, except
at the extreme<a id="FNanchor_1897_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> points of union as it were, being remarkable
neither for its smell<a id="FNanchor_1898_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a> nor its beauty. There is another variety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of rose, too, called the “Grecian” rose by our people, and
“lychnis”<a id="FNanchor_1899_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a> by the Greeks: it grows nowhere except in
humid soils, and has never more than five petals: it does not
exceed the violet in size, and is destitute of smell. There is
another kind, again, known to us as the “Gr&aelig;cula”<a id="FNanchor_1900_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a> the
petals of which are tightly rolled together, and which never
open except when pressed in the hand, it having always the
appearance, in fact, of being in bud: the petals of it are remarkably
large. Another kind, again, springs from a stem
like that of the mallow, the leaves being similar to those of
the olive—the name given to it is “macetum.”<a id="FNanchor_1901_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a> There is
the rose of autumn, too, known to us as the “coroniola,”<a id="FNanchor_1902_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a>
which is of a middle size, between the varieties just mentioned.
All these kinds, however, are destitute of smell, with the
exception of the coroniola, and the one which grows on the
bramble:<a id="FNanchor_1903_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a> so extended is the scope for fictitious<a id="FNanchor_1904_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> productions!</p>

<p>And, indeed, the genuine rose, for the most part, is indebted
for its qualities to the nature of the soil. That of Cyren&aelig;<a id="FNanchor_1905_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> is
the most odoriferous of all, and hence it is that the unguents
of that place are so remarkably fine: at Carthage, again, in
Spain, there are early<a id="FNanchor_1906_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> roses throughout all the winter. The
temperature, too, of the climate is not without its influence:
for in some years we find the roses much less odoriferous than
in others; in addition to which, their smell is always more
powerful when grown in dry soils<a id="FNanchor_1907_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> than in humid ones. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
rose does not admit of being planted in either a rich or an
argillaceous soil, nor yet on irrigated land; being contented
with a thin, light earth, and more particularly attached to
ground on which old building rubbish has been laid.</p>

<p>The rose of Campania is early, that of Miletus late, but it is
the rose of Pr&aelig;neste that goes off the very latest of all. For
the rose, the ground is generally dug to a greater depth than it
is for corn, but not so deep as for the vine. It grows but very
slowly<a id="FNanchor_1908_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a> from the seed, which is found in the calyx beneath the
petals of the flower, covered with a sort of down; hence it is
that the method of grafting is usually the one preferred, or else
propagation from the eyes of the root, as in the reed.<a id="FNanchor_1909_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> One
kind is grafted, which bears a pale flower, with thorny
branches of a remarkable length; it belongs to the quinquefolia
variety, being one of the Greek roses.<a id="FNanchor_1910_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a> All roses are improved
by being pruned and cauterized; transplanting, too, makes
them grow, like the vine, all the better, and with the greatest
rapidity. The slips are cut some four fingers in length or
more, and are planted immediately after the setting of the
Vergili&aelig;; then, while the west winds are prevalent, they are
transplanted at intervals of a foot, the earth being frequently
turned up about them.</p>

<p>Persons whose object it is to grow early roses, make a hole
a foot in width about the root, and pour warm water into it,
at the period when the buds are beginning to put forth.<a id="FNanchor_1911_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_11"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 11. (5.)—THE LILY: FOUR VARIETIES OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The lily holds the next highest rank after the rose, and has
a certain affinity<a id="FNanchor_1912_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a> with it in respect of its unguent and the
oil extracted from it, which is known to us as “lirinon.”<a id="FNanchor_1913_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Blended, too, with roses, the lily<a id="FNanchor_1914_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a> produces a remarkably fine
effect; for it begins to make its appearance, in fact, just as the
rose is in the very middle of its season. There is no flower
that grows to a greater height than the lily, sometimes, indeed,
as much as three cubits; the head of it being always
drooping, as though the neck of the flower were unable to
support its weight. The whiteness of the lily is quite remarkable,
the petals being striated on the exterior; the flower is
narrow at the base, and gradually expanding in shape like a
tapering<a id="FNanchor_1915_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a> cup with the edges curving outwards, the fine pistils
of the flower, and the stamens with their anther&aelig; of a saffron
colour, standing erect in the middle.<a id="FNanchor_1916_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a> Hence the perfume of
the lily, as well as its colour, is two-fold, there being one for
the petals and another for the stamens. The difference, however,
between them is but very small, and when the flower is
employed for making lily unguents and oils, the petals are
never rejected.</p>

<p>There is a flower, not unlike the lily, produced by the plant
known to us as the “convolvulus.”<a id="FNanchor_1917_1917"></a><a href="#Footnote_1917_1917" class="fnanchor">1917</a> It grows among shrubs,
is totally destitute of smell, and has not the yellow anther&aelig; of
the lily within: only vying with it in its whiteness, it would
almost appear to be the rough sketch<a id="FNanchor_1918_1918"></a><a href="#Footnote_1918_1918" class="fnanchor">1918</a> made by Nature when
she was learning how to make the lily. The white lily is
propagated in all the various ways which are employed for the
cultivation of the rose,<a id="FNanchor_1919_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a> as also by means of a certain tearlike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
gum<a id="FNanchor_1920_1920"></a><a href="#Footnote_1920_1920" class="fnanchor">1920</a> which belongs to it, similarly to hipposelinum<a id="FNanchor_1921_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> in fact:
indeed, there is no plant that is more prolific than this, a single
root often giving birth to as many as fifty bulbs.<a id="FNanchor_1922_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a> There
is, also, a red lily, known by the name of “crinon”<a id="FNanchor_1923_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> to the
Greeks, though there are some authors who call the flower of
it “cynorrodon.”<a id="FNanchor_1924_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a> The most esteemed are those of Antiochia

<p>There is a purple<a id="FNanchor_1926_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a> lily, too, which sometimes has a double
stem; it differs only from the other lilies in having a more
fleshy root and a bulb of larger size, but undivided:<a id="FNanchor_1927_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_1927_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> the
name given to it is “narcissus.”<a id="FNanchor_1928_1928"></a><a href="#Footnote_1928_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a> A second variety of this lily
has a white flower, with a purple corolla. There is also this
difference between the ordinary lily and the narcissus, that in
the latter the leaves spring from the root of the plant. The
finest are those which grow on the mountains of Lycia. A
third variety is similar to the others in every respect, except
that the corolla of the plant is green. They are all of them
late<a id="FNanchor_1929_1929"></a><a href="#Footnote_1929_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a> flowers: indeed, they only bloom after the setting of
Arcturus,<a id="FNanchor_1930_1930"></a><a href="#Footnote_1930_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> and at the time of the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>There has been invented<a id="FNanchor_1931_1931"></a><a href="#Footnote_1931_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> also a method of tinting the lily,
thanks to the taste of mankind for monstrous productions.
The dried stalks<a id="FNanchor_1932_1932"></a><a href="#Footnote_1932_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a> of the lily are tied together in the month of
July, and hung up in the smoke: then, in the following
March, when the small knots<a id="FNanchor_1933_1933"></a><a href="#Footnote_1933_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> are beginning to disclose themselves,
the stalks are left to steep in the lees of black or Greek
wine, in order that they may contract its colour, and are then
planted out in small trenches, some semi-sextarii of wine-lees
being poured around them. By this method purple lilies are
obtained, it being a very remarkable thing that we should be
able to dye a plant to such a degree as to make it produce a
coloured flower.</p>

<p>Next after the roses and the lilies, the violet is held in the
highest esteem: of this there are several varieties, the purple,<a id="FNanchor_1934_1934"></a><a href="#Footnote_1934_1934" class="fnanchor">1934</a>
the yellow, and the white, all of them reproduced from
plants, like the cabbage. The purple violet, which springs
up spontaneously in sunny spots, with a thin, meagre soil, has
larger petals than the others, springing immediately from the
root, which is of a fleshy substance. This violet has a name,
too, distinct from the other wild kinds, being called “ion,”<a id="FNanchor_1935_1935"></a><a href="#Footnote_1935_1935" class="fnanchor">1935</a>
and from it the ianthine<a id="FNanchor_1936_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_1936_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a> cloth takes its name.</p>

<p>Among the cultivated kinds, the yellow<a id="FNanchor_1937_1937"></a><a href="#Footnote_1937_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a> violet is held in the
greatest esteem. The Tusculan violet, and that known as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
“marine”<a id="FNanchor_1938_1938"></a><a href="#Footnote_1938_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a> violet, have petals somewhat broader than the
others, but not so odoriferous; the Calatian<a id="FNanchor_1939_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a> violet, too, which
has a smaller leaf, is entirely destitute of smell. This last is

similar colour and size;<a id="FNanchor_1940_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a> in the number of its petals, however,
it surpasses the marine violet, the petals of which are never
more than five in number. The marine violet is surpassed,
too, by the other in smell; that of the caltha being very powerful.
The smell, too, is no less powerful in the plant known as
the “scopa regia;”<a id="FNanchor_1941_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a> but there it is the leaves of the plant,

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_16"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 16.—THE BACCHAR. THE COMBRETUM. ASARUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>The bacchar,<a id="FNanchor_1942_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a> too, by some persons known as “field nard,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
is odoriferous in the root only. In former times, it was the
practice to make unguents of this root, as we learn from the
poet Aristophanes, a writer of the Ancient Comedy; from
which circumstance some persons have erroneously given the
name of “exotic”<a id="FNanchor_1943_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a> to the plant. The smell of it strongly resembles
that of cinnamomum; and the plant grows in thin
soils, which are free from all humidity.</p>

<p>The name of “combretum”<a id="FNanchor_1944_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a> is given to a plant that bears
a very strong resemblance to it, the leaves of which taper to
the fineness of threads; in height, however, it is taller than
the bacchar. These are the only<a id="FNanchor_1945_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> * * * * The error,
however, ought to be corrected, on the part of those who have
bestowed upon the bacchar the name of “field nard;” for that
in reality is the surname given to another plant, known to the
Greeks as “asaron,” the description and features of which we
have already<a id="FNanchor_1946_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> mentioned, when speaking of the different varieties
of nard. I find, too, that the name of “asaron” has
been given to this plant, from the circumstance of its never<a id="FNanchor_1947_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a>
being employed in the composition of chaplets.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_17"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 17.—SAFFRON: IN WHAT PLACES IT GROWS BEST. WHAT
FLOWERS WERE KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE TROJAN WAR.</span></h3></div>

<p>The wild saffron<a id="FNanchor_1948_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a> is the best; indeed, in Italy it is of no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
use whatever to attempt to propagate it, the produce of a whole
bed of saffron being boiled down to a single scruple; it is reproduced
by offsets from the bulb. The cultivated saffron is
larger, finer, and better looking than the other kinds, but has
much less efficacy. This plant is everywhere degenerating,<a id="FNanchor_1949_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a>
and is far from prolific at Cyren&aelig; even, a place where the
flowers are always of the very finest quality. The most esteemed
saffron, however, is that of Cilicia, and there of Mount
Corycus in particular; next comes the saffron of Mount Olympus,
in Lycia, and then of Centuripa, in Sicily; some persons,
however, have given the second rank to the Phlegr&aelig;an<a id="FNanchor_1950_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_1950_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a> saffron.</p>

<p>There is nothing so much adulterated<a id="FNanchor_1951_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_1951_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a> as saffron: the best
proof of its goodness is when it snaps under pressure by the
fingers, as though it were friable;<a id="FNanchor_1952_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a> for when it is moist, a
state which it owes to being adulterated, it is limp, and will
not snap asunder. Another way of testing it, again, is to
apply it with the hand to the face, upon which, if good, it will
be found to be slightly caustic to the face and eyes. There is
a peculiar kind, too, of cultivated saffron, which is in general
extremely mild, being only of middling<a id="FNanchor_1953_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_1953_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a> quality; the name
given to it is “dialeucon.”<a id="FNanchor_1954_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> The saffron of Cyrenaica, again,
is faulty in the opposite extreme; for it is darker than any
other kind, and is apt to spoil very quickly. The best saffron
everywhere is that which is of the most unctuous quality, and
the filaments of which are the shortest; the worst being that
which emits a musty smell.</p>

<p>Mucianus informs us that in Lycia, at the end of seven or
eight years, the saffron is transplanted into a piece of ground
which has been prepared for the purpose, and that in this way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
it is prevented from degenerating. It is never<a id="FNanchor_1955_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> used for chaplets,
being a plant with an extremely narrow leaf, as fine almost
as a hair; but it combines remarkably well with wine, sweet
wine in particular. Reduced to a powder, it is used to perfume<a id="FNanchor_1956_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1956_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a>
the theatres.</p>

<p>Saffron blossoms about the setting of the Vergili&aelig;, for a few
days<a id="FNanchor_1957_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_1957_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a> only, the leaf expelling the flower. It is verdant<a id="FNanchor_1958_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_1958_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a> at
the time of the winter solstice, and then it is that they gather
it; it is usually dried in the shade, and if in winter, all the
better. The root of this plant is fleshy, and more long-lived<a id="FNanchor_1959_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a>
than that of the other bulbous plants. It loves to be beaten
and trodden<a id="FNanchor_1960_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_1960_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> under foot, and in fact, the worse it is treated
the better it thrives: hence it is, that it grows so vigorously
by the side of foot-paths and fountains. (7.) Saffron was
already held in high esteem in the time of the Trojan War;
at all events, Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1961_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_1961_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a> we find, makes mention of these three
flowers, the lotus,<a id="FNanchor_1962_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1962_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a> the saffron, and the hyacinth.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_18"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 18.—THE NATURE OF ODOURS.</span></h3></div>

<p>All the odoriferous<a id="FNanchor_1963_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1963_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> substances, and consequently the plants,
differ from one another in their colour, smell, and juices. It
is but rarely<a id="FNanchor_1964_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1964_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> that the taste of an odoriferous substance is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
bitter; while sweet substances, on the other hand, are but
rarely odoriferous. Thus it is, too, that wine is more odoriferous
than must, and all the wild plants more so than the cultivated
ones.<a id="FNanchor_1965_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_1965_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a> Some flowers have a sweet smell at a distance,
the edge of which is taken off when they come nearer; such is
the case with the violet, for instance. The rose, when fresh
gathered, has a more powerful smell at a distance, and dried,<a id="FNanchor_1966_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a>
when brought nearer. All plants have a more penetrating
odour, also, in spring<a id="FNanchor_1967_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a> and in the morning; as the hour of
midday approaches, the scent becomes gradually weakened.<a id="FNanchor_1968_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a>
The flowers, too, of young plants are less odoriferous than those
of old ones; but it is at mid-age<a id="FNanchor_1969_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> that the odour is most penetrating
in them all.</p>

<p>The rose and the crocus<a id="FNanchor_1970_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> have a more powerful smell when
gathered in fine weather, and all plants are more powerfully
scented in hot climates than in cold ones. In Egypt, however,
the flowers are far from odoriferous, owing to the dews and
exhalations with which the air is charged, in consequence of
the extended surface of the river. Some plants have an agreeable,
though at the same time extremely powerful smell; some,
again, while green, have no<a id="FNanchor_1971_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a> smell at all, owing to the excess
of moisture, the buceros for example, which is the same as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
fenugreek.<a id="FNanchor_1972_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_1972_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a> Not all flowers which have a penetrating odour
are destitute of juices, the violet, the rose, and the crocus, for
example; those, on the other hand, which have a penetrating
odour, but are destitute of juices, have all of them a very powerful
smell, as we find the case with the two varieties<a id="FNanchor_1973_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_1973_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> of the
lily. The abrotonum<a id="FNanchor_1974_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a> and the amaracus<a id="FNanchor_1975_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> have a pungent
smell. In some plants, it is the flower only that is sweet, the
other parts being inodorous, the violet and the rose, for example.</p>

<p>Among the garden plants, the most odoriferous are the dry
ones, such as rue, mint, and parsley, as also those which grow
on dry soils. Some fruits become more odoriferous the older
they are, the quince, for example, which has also a stronger
smell when gathered than while upon the tree. Some plants,
again, have no smell but when broken asunder, or when bruised,
and others only when they are stripped of their bark. Certain
vegetable substances, too, only give out a smell when subjected
to the action of fire, such as frankincense and myrrh, for example.
All flowers are more bitter to the taste when bruised
than when left untouched.<a id="FNanchor_1976_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a> Some plants preserve their smell
a longer time when dried, the melilote, for example; others,
again, make the place itself more odoriferous where they grow,
the iris<a id="FNanchor_1977_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> for instance, which will even render the whole of a
tree odoriferous, the roots of which it may happen to have
touched. The hesperis<a id="FNanchor_1978_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_1978_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a> has a more powerful odour at night,
a property to which it owes its name.</p>

<p>Among the animals, we find none that are odoriferous, unless,
indeed, we are inclined to put faith in what has been said
about the panther.<a id="FNanchor_1979_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_1979_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_19"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 19.—THE IRIS.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is still another distinction, which ought not to be
omitted,—the fact, that many of the odoriferous plants never<a id="FNanchor_1980_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_1980_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a>
enter into the composition of garlands, the iris<a id="FNanchor_1981_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> and the saliunca,
for example, although, both of them, of a most exquisite
odour. In the iris, it is the root<a id="FNanchor_1982_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> only that is held in esteem,
it being extensively employed in perfumery and medicine. The
iris of the finest quality is that found in Illyricum,<a id="FNanchor_1983_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a> and in
that country, even, not in the maritime parts of it, but in the
forests on the banks of the river Drilon<a id="FNanchor_1984_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a> and near Narona.
The next best is that of Macedonia,<a id="FNanchor_1985_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_1985_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a> the plant being extremely
elongated, white, and thin. The iris of Africa<a id="FNanchor_1986_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_1986_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> occupies the
third rank, being the largest of them all, and of an extremely
bitter taste.</p>

<p>The iris of Illyricum comprehends two varieties—one of
which is the raphanitis, so called from its resemblance to the
radish,<a id="FNanchor_1987_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_1987_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> of a somewhat red colour, and superior<a id="FNanchor_1988_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1988_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a> in quality to
the other, which is known as the “rhizotomus.” The best
kind of iris is that which produces sneezing<a id="FNanchor_1989_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a> when handled.
The stem of this plant is a cubit in length, and erect, the flower
being of various colours, like the rainbow, to which circumstance
it is indebted for its name. The iris, too, of Pisidia<a id="FNanchor_1990_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a>
is far from being held in disesteem. Persons<a id="FNanchor_1991_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a> who intend taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
up the iris, drench the ground about it some three months before
with hydromel, as though a sort of atonement offered to
appease the earth; with the point of a sword, too, they trace
three circles round it, and the moment they gather it, they lift
it up towards the heavens.</p>

<p>The iris is a plant of a caustic nature, and when handled, it
causes blisters like burns to rise. It is a point particularly
recommended, that those who gather it should be in a state of
chastity. The root, not only when dried,<a id="FNanchor_1992_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1992_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a> but while still in
the ground, is very quickly attacked by worms. In former
times, it was Leucas and Elis that supplied us with the best
oil<a id="FNanchor_1993_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a> of iris, for there it has long been cultivated; at the present
day, however, the best comes from Pamphylia, though that of
Cilicia and the northern climates is held in high esteem.</p>

<p>The saliunca<a id="FNanchor_1994_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> has a rather short leaf, which does not admit
of its being plaited for garlands, and numerous roots, by which
it is held together; being more of a herb than a flower, and
so closely matted and tangled that it would almost appear to
have been pressed together with the hand—in short, it is a
turf<a id="FNanchor_1995_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> of a peculiar nature. This plant grows in Pannonia and
the sunny regions of Noricum and the Alps, as also the vicinity
of the city of Eporedia;<a id="FNanchor_1996_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> the smell being so remarkably sweet
that the crops of it have been of late quite as profitable as the
working of a mine. This plant is particularly valued for the
pleasant smell it imparts to clothes among which it is kept.</p>

a similar purpose among the Greeks, and highly extolled by

the fact, as they state, that its leaves are white in the morning, a
purple at midday, and azure<a id="FNanchor_1999_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> at sunset. There are two
varieties of it, the field polium, which is larger, and the wild,<a id="FNanchor_2000_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a>

vanquished Nature in the composition of unguents, but has
even gone so far as to challenge, in her fabrics, those flowers
which are more particularly recommended by the beauty of
their tints. I remark that the following are the three principal<a id="FNanchor_2002_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a>
colours; the red, that of the kermes<a id="FNanchor_2003_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> for instance, which,
beginning in the tints of the rose, reflects, when viewed<a id="FNanchor_2004_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_2004_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a> sideways
and held up to the light, the shades that are found in the
Tyrian purple,<a id="FNanchor_2005_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a> and the colours of the dibapha<a id="FNanchor_2006_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a> and Laconian
cloths: the amethystine colour, which is borrowed from the
violet, and to which, bordering as it does on the purple, we
have given the name of “ianthinum”<a id="FNanchor_2007_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a>—it must, however, be
remembered, that we here give a general name to a colour
which is subdivided into numerous tints<a id="FNanchor_2008_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a>—and a third, properly
known as the “conchyliated” colour, but which comprehends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
a variety of shades, such, for instance, as the tints of the heliotropium,
and others of a deeper colour, the hues of the mallow,
inclining to a full purple, and the colours of the late<a id="FNanchor_2009_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a> violet;
this last being the most vivid, in fact, of all the conchyliated
tints. The rival colours being now set side by side, Nature
and luxury may enter the lists, to vie for the mastery.</p>

<p>I find it stated that, in the most ancient times, yellow was
held in the highest esteem, but was reserved exclusively for
the nuptial veils<a id="FNanchor_2010_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a> of females; for which reason it is perhaps
that we do not find it included among the principal colours,
those being used in common by males and females: indeed, it
is the circumstance of their being used by both sexes in common
that gives them their rank as principal colours.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_23"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 23.—THE AMARANTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is no doubt that all the efforts of art are surpassed
by the amaranth,<a id="FNanchor_2011_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a> which is, to speak correctly, rather a purple
ear<a id="FNanchor_2012_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a> than a flower, and, at the same time, quite inodorous. It is
a marvellous feature in this plant, that it takes a delight in being
gathered; indeed, the more it is plucked, the better it grows.
It comes into flower in the month of August, and lasts throughout
the autumn. The finest of all is the amaranth of Alexandria,
which is generally gathered for keeping; for it is a
really marvellous<a id="FNanchor_2013_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a> fact, that when all the other flowers have
gone out, the amaranth, upon being dipped in water, comes to
life again: it is used also for making winter chaplets. The
peculiar quality of the amaranth is sufficiently indicated by
its name, it having been so called from the circumstance that
it never fades.<a id="FNanchor_2014_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a></p>

at a later period. Still, however, who can entertain any

the fact that Italy has only their Greek names by which to

name to the petilium,<a id="FNanchor_2018_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a> an autumnal flower, which springs up
in the vicinity of thorny brakes, and recommends itself solely
by its colour, which is that of the wild rose. The petals of
it are small, and five in number; and it is a remarkable circumstance
in this plant, that the head of it droops at first, and
it is only after it becomes erect that the petals make their appearance,
forming a small corolla of various colours, enclosing
a yellow seed.</p>

<p>The bellio,<a id="FNanchor_2019_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a> too, is a yellow flower, formed of<a id="FNanchor_2020_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_2020_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a> fifty-five
filaments circularly arranged, in the shape of a chaplet. These
are, both of them, meadow flowers, which are mostly of no use
whatever, and consequently without names: even the flowers
just mentioned are known sometimes by one name, and sometimes
by another.</p>

<p>Having thus passed in review nearly all the best-known
colours, we must now give our attention to the chaplets which
are pleasing merely on account of the variety of their materials.
Of such chaplets there are two kinds, one composed of
flowers, the other of leaves. The flowers so employed, I may
say, are those of broom<a id="FNanchor_2022_2022"></a><a href="#Footnote_2022_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a>—the yellow blossom gathered from
it—the rhododendron,<a id="FNanchor_2023_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_2023_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a> and the jujube,<a id="FNanchor_2024_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a> also known as the
tree of Cappadocia, which bears an odoriferous flower similar
to that of the olive. Among the brambles, too, we find the
cyclaminum growing, of which we shall have to speak more
at length on a future occasion:<a id="FNanchor_2025_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> its flower, which reflects the
hues of the purple of Coloss&aelig;,<a id="FNanchor_2026_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> is used as an ingredient in
chaplets.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_28"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 28.—SHRUBS, THE LEAVES OF WHICH ARE USED FOR
CHAPLETS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The leaves, also, of smilax and ivy are employed in chaplets;
indeed, the clusters of these plants are held in the very highest
esteem for this purpose: we have already<a id="FNanchor_2027_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> spoken of them at
sufficient length when treating of the shrubs. There are also
other kinds of shrubs, which can only be indicated by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Greek names, little attention having been paid by the framers
of our language to this branch of nomenclature. Most of
them grow in foreign countries, it is true; but still, it is our
duty to make some mention of them, as it is of Nature in
general that we are speaking, and not of Italy in particular.</p>

<p>Thus it is, that we find employed for chaplets, the leaves of
the melothron,<a id="FNanchor_2028_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a> spir&aelig;a,<a id="FNanchor_2029_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> origanum,<a id="FNanchor_2030_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> cneorum,<a id="FNanchor_2031_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_2031_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> by Hyginus

of Campania, in Greece that of Cape Sunium, and next to that
the produce of Chalcidice and Crete: but wherever this plant
grows it is only to be found in rugged and wild localities. The
name “sertula” or “garland,” which it bears, sufficiently
proves that this plant was formerly much used in the composition
of chaplets. The smell, as well as the flower, closely
resembles that of saffron, though the stem itself is white; the
shorter and more fleshy the leaves, the more highly it is
esteemed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_30"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 30.—THREE VARIETIES OF TREFOIL: THE MYOPHONUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>The leaves of trefoil also are employed for making chaplets.
There are three varieties: the first being called by the Greeks
sometimes “minyanthes,”<a id="FNanchor_2036_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_2036_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a> and sometimes “asphaltion;”
the leaves of it, which the garland-makers employ, are larger
than those of the other kinds. The second variety, known as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the “oxytriphyllon,”<a id="FNanchor_2037_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> has a pointed leaf; and the third has
the smallest leaf of them all. Among these plants there are
some which have a tough, sinewy stem, such as marathron,<a id="FNanchor_2038_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a>
for instance, hippomarathron,<a id="FNanchor_2039_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_2039_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a> and the myophonum.<a id="FNanchor_2040_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a> The umbels,
too, of fennel-giant and the purple flowers<a id="FNanchor_2041_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> of the ivy are
employed for this purpose; as also another kind of ivy very
similar to the wild rose,<a id="FNanchor_2042_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a> the colour only of which is attractive,
the flower being quite inodorous. There are also two<a id="FNanchor_2043_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a> varieties
used of the cneorum, the black and the white, this last being
odoriferous: they are both of them provided with branches,
and they blossom after the autumnal equinox.<a id="FNanchor_2044_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a></p>

<p>(10.) There are the same number of varieties, also, of origanum
employed in making chaplets, one of which is destitute
of seed, the other, which is also odoriferous, being known as
the Cretan<a id="FNanchor_2045_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a> origanum.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_31"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 31.—TWO VARIETIES OF THYME. PLANTS PRODUCED FROM
BLOSSOMS AND NOT FROM SEED.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are also as many varieties of thyme<a id="FNanchor_2046_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> employed, the
one white, the other dark:<a id="FNanchor_2047_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a> it flowers about the summer solstice,
when the bees cull from it. From this plant a sort of
augury is derived, as to how the honey is likely to turn out:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
for the bee-keepers have reason to look for a large crop when
the thyme blossoms in considerable abundance. Thyme receives
great injury from showers of rain, and is very apt to
shed its blossom. The seed of thyme is so minute<a id="FNanchor_2048_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> as to be
imperceptible, and yet that of origanum, which is also extremely
minute, does not escape the sight. But what matters
it that Nature has thus concealed it from our view? For we
have reason to conclude that it exists in the flower itself;
which, when sown in the ground, gives birth to the plant—what
is there, in fact, that the industry of man has left
untried?</p>

<p>The honey of Attica is generally looked upon as the best in
all the world; for which reason it is that the thyme of that
country has been transplanted, being reproduced, as already
stated, with the greatest difficulty, from the blossom. But
there is also another peculiarity in the nature of the thyme of
Attica, which has greatly tended to frustrate these attempts—it
will never live except in the vicinity of breezes from the
sea. In former times, it was the general belief that this is the
case with all kinds of thyme, and that this is the reason why
it does not grow in Arcadia:<a id="FNanchor_2049_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a> at a period when it was universally
supposed, too, that the olive never grows beyond three
hundred stadia<a id="FNanchor_2050_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a> from the sea. But, at the present day, we
know for certain that in the province of Gallia Narbonensis
the Stony Plains<a id="FNanchor_2051_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> are quite overgrown with thyme; this being,
in fact, the only source of revenue to those parts, thousands
of sheep<a id="FNanchor_2052_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a> being brought thither from distant countries to
browse upon the plant.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_32"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 32.—CONYZA.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are two varieties of conyza, also, employed in making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
chaplets, the male<a id="FNanchor_2053_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> plant and the female. The difference
consists in the leaves, those of the female plant being thinner,
more tapering, and narrower, and those of the male being of
an imbricated shape, the plant having a greater number of
branches. The blossom, too, of the male plant is more vivid
than that of the female: in both kinds it is late in making its
appearance, not till after the rising of Arcturus.</p>

<p>The smell of the male conyza is more powerful than that
of the female plant: the latter, however, is of a more penetrating
nature, for which reason it is that the female plant is
held in higher esteem for the treatment of the bites of animals.
The leaves of the female plant have exactly the smell of honey;
and the root of the male has received the name of “libanotis”
from some: we have already made mention<a id="FNanchor_2054_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> of it on a previous

<p>Of the following plants, too, it is only the leaves that are
employed for chaplets—the flower of Jove,<a id="FNanchor_2055_2055"></a><a href="#Footnote_2055_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a> the amaracus,

and wild thyme, all of them ligneous plants, growing
in a manner similar to the rose. The flower of Jove is
pleasing only for its colours, being quite inodorous; which is
the case also with the plant known by the Greek name of
“phlox.”<a id="FNanchor_2059_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a> All the plants, too, which we have just mentioned

in summer, has a powerful but agreeable smell; it is of a
bright golden colour. Left to range at large, it reproduces
itself by layers from the tops of the branches: but when it is
propagated by the hand of man, it is better to grow it from
the seed than from the roots or slips, though even from the seed
it is not grown without considerable trouble. The young
plants are transplanted in summer, which is the case also with
the adonium.<a id="FNanchor_2063_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_2063_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a> They are both of them plants of a very chilly
nature, though, at the same time, they are apt to receive injury

have gained sufficient strength, they throw out branches like
those of rue.</p>

<p>The leucanthemum<a id="FNanchor_2064_2064"></a><a href="#Footnote_2064_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a> has a similar smell to that of the

Syria as sampsuchum.<a id="FNanchor_2065_2065"></a><a href="#Footnote_2065_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> It is reproduced two ways, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
seed and from cuttings, being more long-lived than the preceding
plants, and possessed of a more agreeable smell. The
amaracus, like the abrotonum, has a great abundance of seed,
but while the abrotonum has a single root, which penetrates
deep into the ground, those of the other plant adhere but
lightly to the surface of the earth. Those of the other plants
which love the shade, water, and manure, are generally set
at the beginning of autumn, and even, in some localities, in
spring.</p>

most singular of plants. According to that author, it is of a

of which is not white, but approaches as nearly as possible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the colour of saffron. In Italy, however, it is the white kind
that is the most odoriferous.</p>

SPRING FLOWERS. THE VIOLET. THE CHAPLET ANEMONE.
THE ŒNANTHE. THE MELANION. THE HELICHRYSOS. THE
GLADIOLUS. THE HYACINTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>The first of the flowers that announce the approach of spring
is the white<a id="FNanchor_2071_2071"></a><a href="#Footnote_2071_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a> violet; indeed, in warm localities, it is seen
peeping out in the winter even. Next to it comes the violet
known as the ion, and the purple violet; then the flame-coloured
flower, the name of which is phlox,<a id="FNanchor_2072_2072"></a><a href="#Footnote_2072_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a> but only the wild
one. The cyclaminum<a id="FNanchor_2073_2073"></a><a href="#Footnote_2073_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a> blossoms twice a year, in spring and
autumn, standing equally in awe as it does of summer and
of winter. The narcissus and the lily, in the parts beyond sea,
are a little later than the preceding plants: but in Italy, as
we have already<a id="FNanchor_2074_2074"></a><a href="#Footnote_2074_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a> stated, they are in blossom with the rose.
In Greece, too, the anemone<a id="FNanchor_2075_2075"></a><a href="#Footnote_2075_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a> blooms even later; it is the
flower of a wild bulb, and is altogether different from the one<a id="FNanchor_2076_2076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2076_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a>
which we shall have occasion to mention among the medicinal
plants.</p>

<p>Next, after these, come the œnanthe,<a id="FNanchor_2077_2077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2077_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a> the melanion,<a id="FNanchor_2078_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_2078_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a> and,
among the wild plants, the helichrysos;<a id="FNanchor_2079_2079"></a><a href="#Footnote_2079_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> then, another kind
of anemone, known as the “limonia,”<a id="FNanchor_2080_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2080_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a> and after that the
gladiolus,<a id="FNanchor_2081_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_2081_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a> accompanied by the hyacinth. Last of all, among
the spring flowers, is the rose, which, with the exception indeed
of the cultivated kinds, is also the first to fade. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
the others, the flowers which last the longest, are the hyacinth,
the white violet, and the œnanthe; but to make this
last keep any time in flower, it is necessary to gather it repeatedly,
to prevent it from running to seed. The œnanthe
grows in warm localities, and has exactly the smell of the vine
when in blossom, to which circumstance it is indebted for
its name.</p>

<p>There are two fabulous stories attached to the hyacinth;<a id="FNanchor_2082_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_2082_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a>
according to one of them, it bears the impress of the grief<a id="FNanchor_2083_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_2083_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a>
which Apollo felt for the youth<a id="FNanchor_2084_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_2084_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a> whom he had so tenderly
loved; and we learn from the other, that it derives its name
from the blood<a id="FNanchor_2085_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_2085_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a> of Ajax, the veins being so arranged in the
flower as to form the Greek letters <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΑΙ</span> inscribed upon it.</p>

<p>The helichrysos has a flower resembling gold in appearance,
a small leaf, and a fine, slender, but hard, stem. According
to the Magi, the person who crowns himself with a chaplet
composed of this flower, and takes his unguents from a box
of gold, of the kind generally known as “apyron,”<a id="FNanchor_2086_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_2086_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> will
be sure to secure esteem and glory among his fellowmen.
Such are the flowers of spring.</p>

<p>The summer flowers come next, the lychnis<a id="FNanchor_2087_2087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2087_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> the flower of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>

amaracus, surnamed that of Phrygia. Put the most remarkable
flower of all is the pothos,<a id="FNanchor_2090_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> of which there are two
varieties, one with the flower of the hyacinth,<a id="FNanchor_2091_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a> and another
with a white flower, which is generally found growing about
graves, and is better able to stand bad weather. The iris,<a id="FNanchor_2092_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a>
also, blossoms in summer. All these flowers pass away, however,
and fade; upon which others assume their places in
autumn, a third kind of lily,<a id="FNanchor_2093_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_2093_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> for instance, saffron, and two
varieties of the orsinum<a id="FNanchor_2094_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a>—one of them inodorous and the other
scented—making their appearance, all of them, as soon as the
first autumnal showers fall.</p>

<p>The garland-makers employ the flowers of the thorn<a id="FNanchor_2095_2095"></a><a href="#Footnote_2095_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a> even
for making chaplets; the tender shoots, too, of the white
thorn are sometimes preserved as a choice morsel<a id="FNanchor_2096_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> to tempt
the palate.</p>

<p>Such is the succession of the summer flowers in the parts
beyond sea: in Italy, the violet is succeeded by the rose, the
lily comes on while the rose is still in flower, the cyanus<a id="FNanchor_2097_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> succeeds
the rose, and the amaranth the cyanus. As to the vincapervinca,<a id="FNanchor_2098_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
it is an evergreen, the branches from which run
out like so many strings, the leaves surrounding the stem at
each of the knots: though more generally used for the purposes
of ornamental gardening, it is sometimes employed in
chaplets when there is a deficiency of other flowers. From the
Greeks this plant has received the name of “cham&aelig;daphne.”</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_40"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 40.—THE DURATION OF LIFE IN THE VARIOUS KINDS OF

<p>At the very utmost, the white<a id="FNanchor_2099_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_2099_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a> violet never lasts longer
than three years: should it exceed that period, it is sure to
degenerate. The rose-tree will last so long as five years without
being pruned or cauterized,<a id="FNanchor_2100_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2100_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> methods by which it is made
to grow young again. We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_2101_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2101_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a> that the nature
of the soil is of the very greatest importance; for in
Egypt, we find, all these plants are perfectly inodorous, and
it is only the myrtle that has any particular smell. In some
countries, too, the germination of all the plants precedes that
in other parts of the world by so long a period as two months
even. The rose-beds should be well spaded immediately after
the west winds begin to prevail, and, a second time, at the
summer solstice: every care, however, should be paid, between
these two periods, to keeping the ground well raked and
cleaned.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_41"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 41. (12.)—PLANTS WHICH SHOULD BE SOWN AMONG
FLOWERS FOR BEES. THE CERINTHA.</span></h3></div>

<p>Bees and beehives, too, are a subject extremely well suited
to a description of gardens and garland plants, while, at the
same time, where they are successfully managed, they are a
source, without any great outlay, of very considerable profit.
For bees, then, the following plants should be grown—thyme,
apiastrum, the rose, the various violets, the lily, the cytisus,
the bean, the fitch, cunila, the poppy, conyza,<a id="FNanchor_2102_2102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2102_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> cassia, the melilote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
melissophyllum,<a id="FNanchor_2103_2103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2103_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a> and the cerintha.<a id="FNanchor_2104_2104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2104_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a> This last is a plant
with a white leaf, bent inwards, the stem of it being a cubit
in height, with a flower at the top presenting a concavity full
of a juice like honey. Bees are remarkably fond of the flowers
of these plants, as also the blossoms of mustard, a thing that
is somewhat surprising, seeing that it is a well-known fact that
they will not so much as touch the blossoms of the olive: for
which reason, it will be as well to keep that tree at a distance
from them.<a id="FNanchor_2105_2105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2105_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a></p>

<p>There are other trees, again, which should be planted as
near the hives as possible, as they attract the swarm when it
first wings its flight, and so prevent the bees from wandering
to any considerable distance.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_42"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 42.—THE MALADIES OF BEES, AND THE REMEDIES FOR

<p>The greatest care, too, should be taken to keep the cornel<a id="FNanchor_2106_2106"></a><a href="#Footnote_2106_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a>
at a distance from the hives; for if the bees once taste the
blossoms of it, they will speedily die of flux and looseness.
The best remedy in such case is to give them sorb apples
beaten up with honey, or else human urine or that of oxen, or
pomegranate seeds moistened with Aminean<a id="FNanchor_2107_2107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2107_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> wine. It is a
very good plan, too, to plant broom about the hives, the bees
being extremely fond of the blossoms.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_43"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 43.—THE FOOD OF BEES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In relation to the food of bees, I have ascertained a very
singular fact, and one that well deserves to be mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
There is a village, called Hostilia, on the banks of the river
Padus: the inhabitants of it, when food<a id="FNanchor_2108_2108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2108_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a> fails the bees in their
vicinity, place the hives in boats and convey them some five
miles up the river in the night. In the morning the bees go
forth to feed, and then return to the boats; their locality
being changed from day to day, until at last, as the boats sink
deeper and deeper in the water, it is ascertained that the hives
are full, upon which they are taken home, and the honey is
withdrawn.</p>

<p>(13.) In Spain, too, for the same purpose, they have the
hives carried from place to place on the backs of mules.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_44"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 44.—POISONED HONEY, AND THE REMEDIES TO BE EMPLOYED
BY THOSE WHO HAVE EATEN OF IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>Indeed, the food of bees is of the very greatest importance,
as it is owing to this that we meet with poisonous<a id="FNanchor_2109_2109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2109_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a> honey
even. At Heraclia<a id="FNanchor_2110_2110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2110_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a> in Pontus, the honey is extremely pernicious
in certain years, though it is the same bees that make
it at other times. Authors, however, have not informed us
from what flowers this honey is extracted; we shall, therefore,
take this opportunity of stating what we have ascertained
upon the subject.</p>

<p>There is a certain plant which, from the circumstance that
it proves fatal to beasts of burden, and to goats in particular,
has obtained the name of “&aelig;golethron,”<a id="FNanchor_2111_2111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2111_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a> and the blossoms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
which, steeped in the rains of a wet spring, contract most
noxious properties. Hence it is that it is not every year that
these dangerous results are experienced. The following are
the signs of the honey being<a id="FNanchor_2112_2112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2112_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a> poisonous: it never thickens,
the colour is redder than usual, and it emits a peculiar smell
which immediately produces sneezing; while, at the same
time, it is more weighty than a similar quantity of good
honey. Persons, when they have eaten of it, throw themselves
on the ground to cool the body, which is bathed with a
profuse perspiration. There are numerous remedies, of which
we shall have occasion to speak in a more appropriate place;<a id="FNanchor_2113_2113"></a><a href="#Footnote_2113_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a>
but as it will be as well to mention some of them on the present
occasion, by way of being provided for such insidious accidents,
I will here state that old honied wine is good, mixed
with the finest honey and rue; salt meats, also, taken repeatedly
in small quantities, and as often brought up again.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that dogs, after tasting the excretions
of persons suffering from these attacks, have been attacked
with similar symptoms, and have experienced the same
kind of pains.</p>

<p>Still, however, it is equally well ascertained, that honied
wine prepared from this honey, when old, is altogether innoxious;
and that there is nothing better than this honey, mixed
with costus,<a id="FNanchor_2114_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_2114_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a> for softening the skin of females, or, combined
with aloes, for the treatment of bruises.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_45"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 45.—MADDENING HONEY.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the country of the Sanni, in the same part of Pontus,
there is another kind of honey, which, from the madness it
produces, has received the name of “m&aelig;nomenon.”<a id="FNanchor_2115_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2115_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a> This
evil effect is generally attributed to the flowers of the rhododendron,<a id="FNanchor_2116_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_2116_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a>
with which the woods there abound; and that people,
though it pays a tribute to the Romans in wax, derives no
profit whatever from its honey, in consequence of these dangerous
properties. In Persis, too, and in G&aelig;tulia, a district<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
of Mauritania C&aelig;sariensis, bordering on the country of the
Mass&aelig;syli, there are poisonous honeycombs found; and some,
too, only partly so,<a id="FNanchor_2117_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2117_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a> one of the most insidious things that
possibly could happen, were it not that the livid colour of the
honey gives timely notice of its noxious qualities. What can
we suppose to have possibly been the intention of Nature in
thus laying these traps in our way, giving us honey that is
poisonous in some years and good in others, poisonous in some
parts of the combs and not in others, and that, too, the produce
in all cases of the self-same bees? It was not enough, forsooth,
to have produced a substance in which poison might be administered
without the slightest difficulty, but must she herself
administer it as well in the honey, to fall in the way of so
many animated beings? What, in fact, can have been her
motive, except to render mankind a little more cautious and
somewhat less greedy?</p>

<p>And has she not provided the very bees, too, with pointed
weapons, and those weapons poisoned to boot? So it is, and
I shall, therefore, without delay, set forth the remedies to
counteract the effects of their stings. It will be found a very
excellent plan to foment the part stung with the juice of mallows<a id="FNanchor_2118_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2118_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a>
or of ivy leaves, or else for the person who has been stung
to take these juices in drink. It is a very astonishing thing,
however, that the insects which thus carry these poisons in
their mouths and secrete them, should never die themselves
in consequence; unless it is that Nature, that mistress of all
things, has given to bees the same immunity from the effects
of poison which she has granted against the attacks of serpents
to the Psylli<a id="FNanchor_2119_2119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2119_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a> and the Marsi among men.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_46"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 46. (14.)—HONEY THAT FLIES WILL NOT TOUCH.</span></h3></div>

<p>Another marvellous fact, again, connected with honey in
Crete. Upon Mount Carina in that island, which is nine
miles in circuit, there is not a fly to be found, and the honey
that is made there no fly will touch.<a id="FNanchor_2120_2120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2120_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> It is by this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
that honey said to have come from that district is usually
tested, it being highly prized for medicinal preparations.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_47"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 47.—BEEHIVES, AND THE ATTENTION WHICH SHOULD BE
PAID TO THEM.</span></h3></div>

<p>The hives ought to have an aspect due east,<a id="FNanchor_2121_2121"></a><a href="#Footnote_2121_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> but never looking
towards the north-east or the west. The best hives are
those made of bark, the next best those of fennel-giant, and the
next of osier: many persons, too, have them made of mirror-stone,<a id="FNanchor_2122_2122"></a><a href="#Footnote_2122_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a>
for the purpose of watching<a id="FNanchor_2123_2123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2123_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a> the bees at work within.
It is the best plan to anoint the hives all over with cow-dung.
The lid of the hive should be made to slide from behind, so as
to admit of being shut to within, in case the hive should prove
too large or their labours unproductive; for, if this is not
done, the bees are apt to become discouraged and abandon
their work. The slide may then be gradually withdrawn, the
increase of space being imperceptible to the bees as the work
progresses. In winter, too, the hives should be covered with
straw, and subjected to repeated fumigations, with burnt cow-dung
more particularly. As this is of kindred<a id="FNanchor_2124_2124"></a><a href="#Footnote_2124_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a> origin with
the bees, the smoke produced by it is particularly beneficial in
killing all such insects as may happen to breed there, such as
spiders, for instance, moths,<a id="FNanchor_2125_2125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2125_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a> and wood-worms;<a id="FNanchor_2126_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_2126_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a> while, at the
same time, it stimulates the bees themselves to increased activity.
In fact, there is little difficulty in getting rid of the
spiders, but to destroy the moths, which are a much greater
plague, a night must be chosen in spring, just when the mallow
is ripening, there being no moon, but a clear sky: flambeaux
are then lighted before the hives, upon which the moths
precipitate themselves in swarms into the flame.</p>

<div class="section">

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_48"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 48.—THAT BEES ARE SENSIBLE OF HUNGER.</span></h3></div>

<p>If it is found that the bees are in want of aliment, it will
be a good plan to place at the entrance of the hive raisins or
dried figs beaten up,<a id="FNanchor_2127_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_2127_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> as also carded wool soaked in raisin
wine, boiled<a id="FNanchor_2128_2128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2128_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> must, or hydromel, and sometimes even the raw<a id="FNanchor_2129_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2129_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a>
flesh of poultry. In certain summers, too, when long-continued
drought has deprived them of the nutriment which
they usually derive from flowers, similar food must be provided
for them.</p>

<p>When the honey is taken, the outlets of the hive should be
well rubbed with melissophyllum or broom,<a id="FNanchor_2130_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2130_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> beaten up, or else
the middle of it should be encircled with bands of white vine,
to prevent the bees from taking to flight. It is recommended,
too, that the honey-pots and combs should be washed with
water: this water, boiled, it is said, will make an extremely
wholesome vinegar.<a id="FNanchor_2131_2131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2131_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a></p>

sufficient water to cover them, after which the liquor is strained

best being that of a remarkably yellow colour, with the smell

contained.<a id="FNanchor_2135_2135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2135_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a> The next in quality is the Cretan wax, which
contains the largest proportion of propolis,<a id="FNanchor_2136_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2136_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> a substance of
which we have previously made mention when treating of
bees. Next to these varieties comes the Corsican wax, which,
being the produce of the box-tree, is generally thought to be
possessed of certain medicinal properties.</p>

<p>The Punic wax is prepared in the following manner: yellow
wax is first blanched in the open air, after which it is boiled
in water from the open sea, with the addition of some nitre.<a id="FNanchor_2137_2137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2137_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a>
The flower of the wax, or, in other words, the whitest part of
it, is then skimmed off with spoons, and poured into a vessel
containing a little cold water. After this, it is again boiled
in sea-water by itself, which done, the vessel is left to cool.
When this operation has been three times repeated, the wax is
left in the open air upon a mat of rushes, to dry in the light of
the sun and moon; for while the latter adds to its whiteness,
the sun helps to dry<a id="FNanchor_2138_2138"></a><a href="#Footnote_2138_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a> it. In order, however, that it may not
melt, it is the practice to cover it with a linen cloth: if, when
it has been thus refined, it is boiled once more, the result is a
wax of the greatest possible whiteness.</p>

<p>Punic wax is considered the best for all medicinal preparations.
Wax is made black by the addition of ashes of papyrus,
and a red colour is given to it by the admixture of alkanet;
indeed, by the employment of various pigments, it is
made to assume various tints, in which state it is used for
making models,<a id="FNanchor_2139_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_2139_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> and for other purposes without number,
among which we may mention varnishing walls<a id="FNanchor_2140_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2140_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a> and armour,
to protect them from the air. We have given the other particulars
relative to bees and honey, when speaking<a id="FNanchor_2141_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2141_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a> of the
nature of those insects. We have now stated pretty nearly
all that we have to say on the subject of the pleasure garden.</p>

<p>But the plant of this nature that is the most famous in
Egypt is the colocasia,<a id="FNanchor_2149_2149"></a><a href="#Footnote_2149_2149" class="fnanchor">2149</a> known as the “cyamos”<a id="FNanchor_2150_2150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2150_2150" class="fnanchor">2150</a> to some.

is very remarkable; and the leaves, which are extremely large,
even when compared with those of trees, are very similar to
those of the plant found in our rivers, and known by the
name of “personata.”<a id="FNanchor_2153_2153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2153_2153" class="fnanchor">2153</a> So much do the people of that

<p>In Egypt, next to the colocasia, it is the cichorium that is
held in the highest esteem, a plant which we have already
spoken<a id="FNanchor_2156_2156"></a><a href="#Footnote_2156_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a> of under the name of wild endive.<a id="FNanchor_2157_2157"></a><a href="#Footnote_2157_2157" class="fnanchor">2157</a> It springs up
after the rising of the Vergili&aelig;, and the various portions of it
blossom in succession: the root is supple, and hence is used for
making withes even. The anthalium<a id="FNanchor_2158_2158"></a><a href="#Footnote_2158_2158" class="fnanchor">2158</a> grows at a greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
distance<a id="FNanchor_2159_2159"></a><a href="#Footnote_2159_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a> from the river; the fruit of it is round,<a id="FNanchor_2160_2160"></a><a href="#Footnote_2160_2160" class="fnanchor">2160</a> and about
the size of a medlar, but without either kernel or rind; the
leaves of the plant are similar to those of the cyperus. The
people there eat the fruit of it cooked upon the fire, as also of
the œtum,<a id="FNanchor_2161_2161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2161_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a> a plant which has a few leaves only, and those extremely

anything that makes its appearance above ground.</p>

chondrylla,<a id="FNanchor_2164_2164"></a><a href="#Footnote_2164_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a> the hypochœris,<a id="FNanchor_2165_2165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2165_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a> the caucalis,<a id="FNanchor_2166_2166"></a><a href="#Footnote_2166_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a> the anthriscum,<a id="FNanchor_2167_2167"></a><a href="#Footnote_2167_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a>

in blossom throughout the winter and the spring, until
the following summer.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_53"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 53.—FOUR VARIETIES OF THE CNECOS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Egyptians have many other plants also, of little note;
but they speak in the highest terms of the cnecos;<a id="FNanchor_2177_2177"></a><a href="#Footnote_2177_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a> a plant
unknown to Italy, and which the Egyptians hold in esteem,
not as an article of food, but for the oil it produces, and which
is extracted from the seed. The principal varieties are the
wild and the cultivated kinds; of the wild variety, again, there
are two sorts, one of which is less prickly<a id="FNanchor_2178_2178"></a><a href="#Footnote_2178_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a> than the other, but
with a similar stem, only more upright: hence it is that in
former times females used it for distaffs, from which circumstance
it has received the name of “atractylis”<a id="FNanchor_2179_2179"></a><a href="#Footnote_2179_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a> from some;
the seed of it is white, large, and bitter. The other variety<a id="FNanchor_2180_2180"></a><a href="#Footnote_2180_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a>
is more prickly, and has a more sinewy stem, which may be
said almost to creep upon the ground; the seed is small. The
cnecos belongs to the thorny plants: indeed, it will be as well
to make some classification of them.</p>

<p>For some plants, in fact, are thorny, while others, again, are
destitute of prickles: the species of thorny plants are very
numerous. The asparagus<a id="FNanchor_2181_2181"></a><a href="#Footnote_2181_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a> and the scorpio<a id="FNanchor_2182_2182"></a><a href="#Footnote_2182_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a> are essentially
thorny plants, having no leaves at all upon them. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
plants, again, that are prickly have leaves as well, such as the
thistle, for instance, the erynge,<a id="FNanchor_2183_2183"></a><a href="#Footnote_2183_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a> the glycyrriza,<a id="FNanchor_2184_2184"></a><a href="#Footnote_2184_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a> and the
nettle;<a id="FNanchor_2185_2185"></a><a href="#Footnote_2185_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a> all these plants being provided with leaves that prick
or sting.</p>

<p>Some plants have thorns at the base of their leaves, the
tribulus<a id="FNanchor_2186_2186"></a><a href="#Footnote_2186_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a> and the anonis<a id="FNanchor_2187_2187"></a><a href="#Footnote_2187_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a> for instance; others, again, have
thorns, not on the leaves but on the stem, the pheos<a id="FNanchor_2188_2188"></a><a href="#Footnote_2188_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a> for example,
known as the stœbe to some. The hippopha&euml;s<a id="FNanchor_2189_2189"></a><a href="#Footnote_2189_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> has
thorns at the joints; the tribulus presents the peculiarity of
bearing a fruit that is thorny.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_55"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 55.—FOUR VARIETIES OF THE NETTLE. THE LAMIUM

<p>But of all these plants, it is the nettle that is the best
known to us, the calyces<a id="FNanchor_2190_2190"></a><a href="#Footnote_2190_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a> of the blossoms of which produce a
purple down: it frequently exceeds two cubits even in
height.<a id="FNanchor_2191_2191"></a><a href="#Footnote_2191_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a> There are numerous varieties of this plant; the
wild nettle, known also as the female nettle, does not inflict
so bad a sting as the others. Among the several varieties of
the wild nettle, the one known as the dog<a id="FNanchor_2192_2192"></a><a href="#Footnote_2192_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a>-nettle, stings the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
worst, the stem of it even possessing that property; the leaves
of the nettle are indented at the edge. There is one kind
also, which emits a smell, known as the Herculanean<a id="FNanchor_2193_2193"></a><a href="#Footnote_2193_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a> nettle.
The seed of all the nettles is copious, and black. It is a singular
fact that, though possessed of no spinous points, the
down<a id="FNanchor_2194_2194"></a><a href="#Footnote_2194_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a> of the nettle is of a noxious nature, and that, though
ever so lightly touched, it will immediately produce an itching
sensation, and raise a blister on the flesh similar in appearance
to a burn: the well-known remedy for it is olive oil.</p>

<p>The stinging property of the nettle does not belong to the
plant at the earliest period of its growth, but only developes
itself under the influence of the sun. The plant first begins
to grow in the spring, at which period it is by no means a
disagreeable food;<a id="FNanchor_2195_2195"></a><a href="#Footnote_2195_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a> indeed, it has become quite a religious observance
to employ it as such, under the impression that it is
a preventive from diseases the whole year through. The root,
too, of the wild nettle, has the effect of rendering all meat
more tender that is boiled with it.<a id="FNanchor_2196_2196"></a><a href="#Footnote_2196_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a> The kind that is innoxious
and destitute of all stinging properties, is known as the “lamium.”<a id="FNanchor_2197_2197"></a><a href="#Footnote_2197_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a>
Of the scorpio<a id="FNanchor_2198_2198"></a><a href="#Footnote_2198_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a> we shall have occasion to speak

<p>The carduus<a id="FNanchor_2199_2199"></a><a href="#Footnote_2199_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a> has leaves and a stem covered with a prickly

however, has no prickles upon the leaves. There is, however,
this difference among these plants, that some of them have
numerous stems and branches, such as the carduus, for instance;
while others, again, have a single stem and no branches,
the cnecos, for example. Some, again, such as the erynge,<a id="FNanchor_2209_2209"></a><a href="#Footnote_2209_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a>
are prickly at the head only; and some blossom in the summer,
the tetralix and the helxine, for instance. The scolymos
blossoms late, and remains a considerable period in flower:
the acorna being distinguished only for its red colour and its
unctuous juice. The atractylis would be similar in every
respect to the last, were it not that it is somewhat whiter,
and produces a juice the colour of blood, a circumstance to
which it owes the name of “phonos,”<a id="FNanchor_2210_2210"></a><a href="#Footnote_2210_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a> given to it by some.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
The smell of this plant is powerful, and the seed only ripens
at a late period, and never before autumn, although the same
may be said of all the prickly plants, in fact. All of them
are capable, however, of being reproduced from either seed
or root.</p>

<p>The scolymos, which belongs to the thistle<a id="FNanchor_2211_2211"></a><a href="#Footnote_2211_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a> genus, differs
from the rest of them in the circumstance that the root of it
is boiled and eaten. It is a singular fact that this genus of
plants bears blossoms, buds, and fruit the whole of the summer
through, without any interruption: when the leaf is dried,
the prickles lose their pungency. The helxine is a plant but
rarely seen, and in some countries only. It throws out leaves
at the root, from the middle of which there is a protuberance
in the shape of an apple, covered with leaves of its own: the
head of it contains a thick juice of a sweet flavour, the name
given to which is “acanthice mastiche.”<a id="FNanchor_2212_2212"></a><a href="#Footnote_2212_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a></p>

peculiar characteristics of its own: the root throws out stalks

plant, however, has one stem which grows upright, and is
known by the name of “pternix;” it has the same sweet
flavour as the other parts, though it will not keep. The seed
of it is covered with a kind of down, known as “pappus:”<a id="FNanchor_2215_2215"></a><a href="#Footnote_2215_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a>
when this is removed, as well as the rind<a id="FNanchor_2216_2216"></a><a href="#Footnote_2216_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a> of the fruit, it is

are two varieties of this plant; the one<a id="FNanchor_2219_2219"></a><a href="#Footnote_2219_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a> with leaves like those
of the chicheling vetch, the other with leaves protected by
prickles. This last variety blossoms also at a later period
than the other, and is mostly found in the hedge-rows about
farm-houses. The seed of it is black, rounder than that of the
other, and enclosed in pods: that of the other variety bears a
resemblance to sand.</p>

<p>Among the prickly plants there is also another kind, known
as the “anonis:”<a id="FNanchor_2220_2220"></a><a href="#Footnote_2220_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a> indeed, it has thorns upon the branches,
to which leaves are attached similar to those of rue, the stem
being entirely covered also with leaves, in form resembling a
garland. It comes up in land that has been newly ploughed,
being highly prejudicial to the corn, and long-lived in the
extreme.</p>

<p>The leaves of plants, as well as those of trees, differ from
one another in the length of the footstalk, and in the breadth

on its edge. Other differences are also constituted in

<p>The peculiarities also of the squill and saffron deserve remark;
for while all other plants put forth their leaves first,
and then a round stem, these show the stem before the leaf
makes its appearance: in the saffron, however, the blossom is
protruded by the stem, but in the squill it is the stem that
first makes its appearance, and then the flower emerges from
it. This plant blossoms three times in the year, indicating
thereby, as previously stated,<a id="FNanchor_2256_2256"></a><a href="#Footnote_2256_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a> the three seasons for ploughing.</p>

<p>Other plants of the bulbous kind differ in the leaf: that of
the asphodel<a id="FNanchor_2259_2259"></a><a href="#Footnote_2259_2259" class="fnanchor">2259</a> is long and narrow, that of the squill broad and
supple, and the form of that of the gladiolus is bespoken by its
name.<a id="FNanchor_2260_2260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2260_2260" class="fnanchor">2260</a> The asphodel is used as an article of food, the seed of
it being parched, and the bulb roasted;<a id="FNanchor_2261_2261"></a><a href="#Footnote_2261_2261" class="fnanchor">2261</a> this last, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
should be cooked in hot ashes, and then eaten with salt and
oil. It is beaten up also with figs, and forms, as Hesiod assures
us, a very delicate dish. It is said, too, that the asphodel,
planted before the doors of a farm-house, will act as a preservative
against the effects of noxious spells.</p>

<p>Homer,<a id="FNanchor_2262_2262"></a><a href="#Footnote_2262_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a> too, makes mention of the asphodel. The bulbs
of it are like moderately-sized turnips, and there is no plant
the root of which has more of them, as many as eighty bulbs
being often grouped together. Theophrastus, and nearly all
the Greek writers, with Pythagoras at the head of them, have
given the name of “anthericos” to its stem, which is one cubit,
and often two, in length, the leaves being very similar to those
of the wild leek; it is to the root, or in other words, the bulbs,
that they have given the name of asphodel. The people of our
country call this plant<a id="FNanchor_2263_2263"></a><a href="#Footnote_2263_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a> “albucus,” and they give the name
of “royal<a id="FNanchor_2264_2264"></a><a href="#Footnote_2264_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a> spear” to the asphodel the stem of which bears
berries,<a id="FNanchor_2265_2265"></a><a href="#Footnote_2265_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a> thus distinguishing two<a id="FNanchor_2266_2266"></a><a href="#Footnote_2266_2266" class="fnanchor">2266</a> varieties of it. The albucus
has a stalk a cubit in length, large, naked, and smooth, in
reference to which, Mago recommends that it should be cut at
the end of March and the beginning of April, the period at
which it blossoms, and before the seed has begun to swell; he
says, too, that the stalks should be split, and exposed on the
fourth day in the sun, after which, when dry, they should be
made up into bundles.</p>

<p>The same author states, also, that the Greeks give the name
of “pistana” to the aquatic plant known to us as the “sagitta;”<a id="FNanchor_2267_2267"></a><a href="#Footnote_2267_2267" class="fnanchor">2267</a>
and he recommends that it should be stripped of its
bark, and dried in a mild sun, between the ides of May<a id="FNanchor_2268_2268"></a><a href="#Footnote_2268_2268" class="fnanchor">2268</a> and
the end of October. He says, too, that it is usual to cut down
to the root, throughout all the month of July, the variety of
the gladiolus called “cypiros,” which is a marsh-plant also,
and at the end of three days to dry it in the sun, until it turns
white; but that care must be taken every day to carry it under
cover before sunset, the night dews being very injurious to
marsh plants when cut.</p>

DERIVED FROM THE CYPIROS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Mago has likewise given similar recommendations as to the
rush known to us as the “mariscus,”<a id="FNanchor_2269_2269"></a><a href="#Footnote_2269_2269" class="fnanchor">2269</a> and which is so extensively
employed for weaving mats. He says that it should be
gathered in the month of June, up to the middle of July, and
for drying it he gives the same precepts that have been already<a id="FNanchor_2270_2270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2270_2270" class="fnanchor">2270</a>
mentioned, in the appropriate place, when speaking of
sedge. He describes a second kind, also, which I find is
generally called the “marine” rush, and is known to the
Greeks as the “oxyschœnos.”<a id="FNanchor_2271_2271"></a><a href="#Footnote_2271_2271" class="fnanchor">2271</a></p>

<p>Generally speaking, there are three varieties of this last
rush: the pointed rush, which is barren, and by the Greeks
is called the male rush and the “oxys:”<a id="FNanchor_2272_2272"></a><a href="#Footnote_2272_2272" class="fnanchor">2272</a> the female rush,<a id="FNanchor_2273_2273"></a><a href="#Footnote_2273_2273" class="fnanchor">2273</a>
which bears a black seed, and is called the “melancranis,”<a id="FNanchor_2274_2274"></a><a href="#Footnote_2274_2274" class="fnanchor">2274</a>
thicker and more bushy than the preceding one: and a third
kind, called the “holoschœnus,”<a id="FNanchor_2275_2275"></a><a href="#Footnote_2275_2275" class="fnanchor">2275</a> which is larger still. Of
these varieties, the melancranis grows separately from the
others, but the oxys and the holoschœnus will grow upon the
self-same clod. The holoschœnus is the most useful for all
kinds of basket-work, being of a particularly supple and fleshy
nature; it bears a fruit, which resembles eggs attached to one
another. The rush, again, which we have spoken of as the
male rush,<a id="FNanchor_2276_2276"></a><a href="#Footnote_2276_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a> is reproduced from itself, the summit of it being
bent down into the earth; the melancranis, however, is propagated
from seed. Beyond this, the roots of all the varieties of
the rush die every year.</p>

<p>The rush is in general use for making kipes<a id="FNanchor_2277_2277"></a><a href="#Footnote_2277_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a> for sea-fishing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the more light and elegant kinds of basket-work, and the
wicks of lamps, for which last purpose the pith is more particularly
employed.<a id="FNanchor_2278_2278"></a><a href="#Footnote_2278_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a> In the vicinity of the maritime Alps,
the rushes grow to such a vast size, that when split they measure
nearly an inch in diameter; while in Egypt, on the other
hand, they are so extremely fine, that the people there make
sieves of them, for which, indeed, there can be nothing better.</p>

<p>Some authors, again, distinguish another kind of rush, of a
triangular shape, to which they give the name of cyperos,<a id="FNanchor_2279_2279"></a><a href="#Footnote_2279_2279" class="fnanchor">2279</a>
though many persons make no distinction between it and the
“cypiros,” in consequence of the resemblance of the names;
for our own part, however, we shall observe the distinction.
The cypiros, as we have already<a id="FNanchor_2280_2280"></a><a href="#Footnote_2280_2280" class="fnanchor">2280</a> stated, is identical with the
gladiolus, a plant with a bulbous root, the most esteemed being
those grown in the Isle of Crete, the next best those of Naxos,
and the next those of Phœnicia. The cypiros of Crete is
white, with an odour strongly resembling that of nard; the
produce of Naxos has a more pungent smell, that of Phœnicia
but little odour of any kind, and that of &AElig;gypt none at all;
for it grows in that country as well.</p>

<p>This plant disperses hard tumours of the body—for we shall
here begin to speak of the remedies derived from the various
flowers and odoriferous plants, they being, all of them, of very
considerable utility in medicine. As to the cypiros, then, I
shall follow Apollodorus, who forbids it to be taken in drink,
though at the same time he admits that it is extremely useful
for calculi of the bladder, and recommends it in fomentations
for the face. He entertains no doubt, however, that it is productive
of abortion, and he mentions, as a remarkable fact,
that the barbarians,<a id="FNanchor_2281_2281"></a><a href="#Footnote_2281_2281" class="fnanchor">2281</a> by inhaling the fumes of this plant at
the mouth, thereby diminish the volume of the spleen. They
never go out of the house, he says, till they have inhaled these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
fumes, through the agency of which they daily become stronger
and stronger, and more robust. He states, also, that the cypiros,
employed as a liniment with oil, is an undoubted remedy
for chafing of the skin, and offensive odours of the arm-pits.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_70"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 70.—THE CYPEROS: FOURTEEN REMEDIES. THE CYPERIS.
THE CYPIRA.</span></h3></div>

<p>The cyperos, as we have just stated, is a rush of angular shape,
white near the ground, and black and solid at the top. The
lower leaves are more slender than those of the leek, and those
at the top are small, with the seed of the plant lying between
them. The root resembles a black olive,<a id="FNanchor_2282_2282"></a><a href="#Footnote_2282_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a> and when it is of
an oblong shape, the plant is known as the “cyperis,”<a id="FNanchor_2283_2283"></a><a href="#Footnote_2283_2283" class="fnanchor">2283</a> being
employed in medicine to a great extent. The cyperos most
highly esteemed is that of the vicinity of the Temple of Jupiter
Hammon, the next best being that of Rhodes, the next
that of Ther&aelig;, and the worst of all that of Egypt, a circumstance
which tends greatly to add to the misunderstanding on the
subject, as that country produces the cypiros as well: but the
cypiros which grows there is extremely hard, and has hardly
any smell at all, while all the other<a id="FNanchor_2284_2284"></a><a href="#Footnote_2284_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a> varieties of it have an
odour strongly resembling that of nard.</p>

<p>There is also an Indian plant, called the “cypira,”<a id="FNanchor_2285_2285"></a><a href="#Footnote_2285_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a> of a
totally different character, and similar to ginger in appearance;
when chewed, it has exactly the flavour of saffron.</p>

<p>The cyperos, employed medicinally, is possessed of certain
depilatory properties. It is used in liniments for hang-nails
and ulcerous sores of the genitals and of all parts of the body
which are of a humid nature, ulcers of the mouth, for instance.
The root of it is a very efficacious remedy for the stings of serpents
and scorpions. Taken in drink, it removes obstructions
of the uterus, but if employed in too large doses, it is liable to
cause prolapsus of that organ. It acts also as a diuretic, and
expels calculi of the bladder; properties which render it extremely
useful in dropsy. It is employed topically, also, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
serpiginous ulcers, those of the throat more particularly, being
usually applied with wine or vinegar.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_71"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 71.—THE HOLOSCHŒNUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The root of the rush, boiled down to one third in three
hemin&aelig; of water, is a cure for cough; the seed of it, parched
and taken in water, arrests looseness of the bowels and the
menstrual discharge, though at the same time it causes headache.
The name given to this rush is holoschœnus; the parts
of it nearest the root are chewed, as a cure for the bites of
spiders.</p>

name of which is “euripice;”<a id="FNanchor_2286_2286"></a><a href="#Footnote_2286_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a> the seed, they say, is narcotic,

RUSH, OR TEUCHITES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We will also take this opportunity of mentioning the medicinal
properties of the sweet-scented rush, which is found
in Cœle-Syria, as already stated by us in the appropriate
place.<a id="FNanchor_2287_2287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2287_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a> The most esteemed kind, however, is that which
grows in the country of the Nabat&aelig;i, and is known as the
“teuchites;”<a id="FNanchor_2288_2288"></a><a href="#Footnote_2288_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a> the next best being the produce of Babylonia,
and the very worst that of Africa, which is entirely destitute
of smell. This rush is round, and when applied to the tongue,
has a pungent, vinous flavour. The genuine kind, when
rubbed, gives out an odour like that of the rose, and when
broken asunder it is red within. It dispels flatulency, and
hence it is very good for the stomach, and for persons when
vomiting the bile or blood. It arrests hiccup also, promotes
eructations, acts as a diuretic, and is curative of affections of
the bladder. A decoction of it is used for female complaints;
and in cases of opisthotony, it is applied in plasters with dry
resin, these being highly valued for their warming properties.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_73"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 73.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE FLOWERS BEFORE MENTIONED:
THIRTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ROSE.
</span></h3></div>

<p>The rose is of an astringent and refreshing nature. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
medicinal purposes the petals, the flowers, and the heads are
used. Those portions of the petals which are quite white are
known as the unglets.<a id="FNanchor_2289_2289"></a><a href="#Footnote_2289_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a> In the flower there is the seed, as
distinguished from the filaments, and in the head there is the
bud,<a id="FNanchor_2290_2290"></a><a href="#Footnote_2290_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a> as well as the calyx. The petals are dried, or else the
juice is extracted from them, by one of the three following
methods: Either the leaves are employed whole for the purpose,
the unglets not being removed—for these are the parts,
in fact, that contain the most juice—or else the unglets are
first taken off and the residue is then macerated with oil or
wine, in glass vessels placed in the sun. Some persons add
salt as well, and others alkanet,<a id="FNanchor_2291_2291"></a><a href="#Footnote_2291_2291" class="fnanchor">2291</a> or else aspalathus or sweet-scented
rush; as it is, when thus prepared, a very valuable remedy
for diseases of the uterus and for dysentery. According
to the third process, the unglets are removed from the petals,
and pounded, after which they are subjected to pressure in a
coarse linen cloth, the juice being received in a copper vessel;
it is then boiled on a slow fire, until it has acquired the consistence
of honey; for this purpose, however, the most odoriferous
of the petals should be selected.</p>

<p>(19.) We have already stated,<a id="FNanchor_2292_2292"></a><a href="#Footnote_2292_2292" class="fnanchor">2292</a> when speaking of the various
kinds of wines, how rose wine is made. Rose juice is
much used in injections for the ears, and as a gargle for ulcerations
of the mouth, and for the gums and tonsils; it is employed
also for the stomach, maladies of the uterus, diseases
of the rectum, and for head-ache. In fevers, it is used, either
by itself or in combination with vinegar, as a remedy for
sleeplessness and nausea. The petals, charred, are used as a
cosmetic for the eyebrows;<a id="FNanchor_2293_2293"></a><a href="#Footnote_2293_2293" class="fnanchor">2293</a> and the thighs, when chafed, are
rubbed with them dried; reduced to powder, too, they are
soothing for defluxions of the eyes. The flower of the rose is
soporific, and taken in oxycrate it arrests fluxes in females,
the white flux in particular; also spitting of blood, and pains
in the stomach, if taken in three cyathi of wine, in sufficient
quantity to flavour it.</p>

<p>As to the seed of the rose, the best is that which is of a saffron
colour, and not more than a year old; it should be dried,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
too, in the shade. The black seed is worthless. In cases of
tooth-ache, the seed is employed in the form of a liniment; it
acts also as a diuretic, and is used as a topical application for
the stomach, as also in cases of erysipelas which are not inveterate:
inhaled at the nostrils, it has the effect of clearing
the brain. The heads of roses, taken in drink, arrest looseness of
the bowels and h&aelig;morrhage. The unglets of the rose are
wholesome in cases of defluxion of the eyes; but the rose is
very apt to taint all ulcerous sores of the eyes, if it is not applied
at the very beginning of the defluxion, dried, and in
combination with bread. The petals, too, taken internally, are
extremely wholesome for gnawing pains of the stomach, and
for maladies of the abdomen or intestines; as also for the thoracic
organs, if applied externally even: they are preserved, too,
for eating, in a similar manner to lapathum. Great care must
be taken in drying rose-leaves, as they are apt to turn mouldy
very quickly.</p>

<p>The petals, too, from which the juice has been extracted,
may be put to some use when dried: powders,<a id="FNanchor_2294_2294"></a><a href="#Footnote_2294_2294" class="fnanchor">2294</a> for instance,
may be made from them, for the purpose of checking the perspiration.
These powders are sprinkled on the body, upon
leaving the bath, and are left to dry on it, after which they are
washed off with cold water. The little excrescences<a id="FNanchor_2295_2295"></a><a href="#Footnote_2295_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a> of
the wild rose, mixed with bears’-grease,<a id="FNanchor_2296_2296"></a><a href="#Footnote_2296_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> are a good remedy
for alopecy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_74"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 74.—TWENTY-ONE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE LILY.</span></h3></div>

<p>The roots of the lily<a id="FNanchor_2297_2297"></a><a href="#Footnote_2297_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a> ennoble that flower in manifold ways
by their utility in a medicinal point of view. Taken in wine,
they are good for the stings of serpents, and in cases of poisoning
by fungi. For corns on the feet, they are applied boiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
in wine, not being taken off before the end of three days. A
decoction of them with grease or oil, has the effect of making
the hair grow again upon burns. Taken with honied wine,
they carry off corrupt blood by stool; they are good, also, for
the spleen and for hernia, and act as an emmenagogue. Boiled
in wine and applied with honey, they are curative of wounds
of the sinews. They are good, too, for lichens, leprous sores,
and scurf upon the face, and they efface wrinkles of the body.</p>

<p>The petals of the lily are boiled in vinegar, and applied, in
combination with polium,<a id="FNanchor_2298_2298"></a><a href="#Footnote_2298_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a> to wounds; if it should happen,
however, to be a wound of the testes, it is the best plan to
apply the other ingredients with henbane and wheat-meal.
Lily-seed is applied in cases of erysipelas, and the flowers and
leaves are used as a cataplasm for inveterate ulcers. The
juice which is extracted from the flower is called “honey”<a id="FNanchor_2299_2299"></a><a href="#Footnote_2299_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a>
by some persons, and “syrium” by others; it is employed as
an emollient for the uterus, and is also used for the purpose of
promoting perspirations, and for bringing suppurations to a
head.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_75"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 75.—SIXTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE NARCISSUS.</span></h3></div>

<p>Two varieties of the narcissus are employed in medicine,
the one with a purple<a id="FNanchor_2300_2300"></a><a href="#Footnote_2300_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a> flower, and the herbaceous narcissus.<a id="FNanchor_2301_2301"></a><a href="#Footnote_2301_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a>
This last is injurious to the stomach, and hence it is that it
acts both as an emetic and as a purgative: it is prejudicial,
also, to the sinews, and produces dull, heavy pains in the head:
hence it is that it has received its name, from “narce,”<a id="FNanchor_2302_2302"></a><a href="#Footnote_2302_2302" class="fnanchor">2302</a> and
not from the youth Narcissus, mentioned in fable. The roots of
both kinds of narcissus have a flavour resembling that of wine
mixed with honey. This plant is very useful, applied to
burns with a little honey, as also to other kinds of wounds,
and sprains. Applied topically, too, with honey and oatmeal,
it is good for tumours, and it is similarly employed for the
extraction of foreign substances from the body.</p>

<p>Beaten up in polenta and oil it effects the cure of contusions
and blows inflicted by stones; and, mixed with meal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>
it effectually cleanses wounds, and speedily removes black
morphews from the skin. Of this flower oil of narcissus is
made, good for softening indurations of the skin, and for warming
parts of the body that have been frost-bitten. It is very
beneficial, also, for the ears, but is very apt to produce
head-ache.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_76"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 76.—SEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VIOLET.
</span></h3></div>

<p>There are both wild and cultivated violets.<a id="FNanchor_2303_2303"></a><a href="#Footnote_2303_2303" class="fnanchor">2303</a> The purple
violet is of a cooling nature: for inflammations they are applied
to the stomach in the burning heats, and for pains in the
head they are applied to the forehead. Violets, in particular,
are used for defluxions of the eyes, prolapsus of the fundament
and uterus, and suppurations. Worn in chaplets upon the
head, or even smelt at, they dispel the fumes of wine and head-ache;
and, taken in water, they are a cure for quinsy. The
purple violet, taken in water, is a remedy for epilepsy, in
children more particularly: violet seed is good for the stings
of scorpions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the flower of the white violet opens suppurations,
and the plant itself disperses them. Both the white
and the yellow violet check the menstrual discharge, and act
as diuretics. When fresh gathered, they have less virtue, and
hence it is that they are mostly used dry, after being kept a
year. The yellow violet, taken in doses of half a cyathus to
three cyathi of water, promotes the catamenia; and the roots
of it, applied with vinegar, assuage affections of the spleen, as
also the gout. Mixed with myrrh and saffron, they are good
for inflammation of the eyes. The leaves, applied with honey,
cleanse ulcerous sores of the head, and, combined with cerate,<a id="FNanchor_2304_2304"></a><a href="#Footnote_2304_2304" class="fnanchor">2304</a>
they are good for chaps of the fundament and other moist parts
of the body. Employed with vinegar, they effect the cure of
abscesses.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_77"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 77.—SEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE BACCHAR.
ONE REMEDY DERIVED FROM THE COMBRETUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>The bacchar that is used in medicine is by some of our
writers called the “perpressa.” It is very useful for the stings
of serpents, head-ache and burning heats in the head, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
for defluxions of the eyes. It is applied topically for swellings
of the mamill&aelig; after delivery, as also incipient fistulas<a id="FNanchor_2305_2305"></a><a href="#Footnote_2305_2305" class="fnanchor">2305</a> of the
eyes, and erysipelas; the smell of it induces sleep. It is
found very beneficial to administer a decoction of the root for
spasms, falls with violence, convulsions, and asthma. For an
inveterate cough, three or four roots of this plant are boiled
down to one-third; this decoction acting also as a purgative
for women after miscarriage, and removing stitch in the side,
and calculi of the bladder. Drying powders<a id="FNanchor_2306_2306"></a><a href="#Footnote_2306_2306" class="fnanchor">2306</a> for perspiration
are prepared also from this plant; and it is laid among garments

<p>It is generally stated that asarum<a id="FNanchor_2309_2309"></a><a href="#Footnote_2309_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a> is good for affections of
the liver, taken in doses of one ounce to a semisextarius of
honied wine mixed with water. It purges the bowels like
hellebore, and is good for dropsy and affections of the thoracic
organs and uterus, as also for jaundice. When mixed with
must, it makes a wine with strongly diuretic qualities. It
is taken up as soon as it begins to put forth its leaves, and is
dried in the shade. It is apt however to turn mouldy very
speedily.</p>

deferring further notice of it till the present occasion. In
doses of two drachm&aelig;, taken in wine, it is good for the stings
of serpents; and taken in water or in wine it is employed for
inflations of the colon, maladies of the liver or kidneys, and
suffusions of the gall. Employed by itself or in combination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_81"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 81.—TWENTY REMEDIES DERIVED FROM SAFFRON.</span></h3></div>

<p>Saffron does not blend well with honey, or, indeed, with any
sweet substance, though very readily with wine or water: it
is extremely useful in medicine, and is generally kept in horn
boxes. Applied with egg it disperses all kinds of inflammation,
those of the eyes in particular: it is employed also for
hysterical suffocations, and for ulcerations of the stomach, chest,
kidneys, liver, lungs, and bladder. It is particularly useful
also in cases of inflammation of those parts, and for cough and
pleurisy. It likewise removes itching<a id="FNanchor_2313_2313"></a><a href="#Footnote_2313_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a> sensations, and acts as
a diuretic. Persons who have used the precaution of first
taking saffron in drink will never experience surfeit or head-ache,
and will be proof against inebriation. Chaplets too,
made of saffron, and worn on the head, tend to dispel the fumes
of wine. The flower of it is employed topically with Cimolian<a id="FNanchor_2314_2314"></a><a href="#Footnote_2314_2314" class="fnanchor">2314</a>
chalk for erysipelas. It is used also in the composition

REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SALIUNCA.
</span></h3></div>

<p>The red iris is better than the white one. It is very beneficial
to attach this plant to the bodies of infants more particularly
when they are cutting their teeth, or are suffering
from cough; it is equally good, too, to inject a few drops of it
when children are suffering from tape-worm. The other properties
of it differ but very little from those of honey. It
cleanses ulcerous sores of the head, and inveterate abscesses
more particularly. Taken in doses of two drachm&aelig; with honey,
it relaxes the bowels; and an infusion of it is good for cough,
gripings of the stomach, and flatulency: taken with vinegar,
too, it cures affections of the spleen. Mixed with oxycrate it
is good for the bites of serpents and spiders, and, in doses of
two drachm&aelig; with bread or water, it is employed for the cure
of the stings of scorpions. It is applied also topically with oil
to the bites of dogs, and to parts that are excoriated: employed
in a similar manner, too, it is good for pains in the sinews, and
in combination with resin it is used as a liniment for lumbago
and sciatica. The properties of this plant are of a warming
nature. Inhaled at the nostrils, it produces sneezing and
cleanses the brain, and in cases of head-ache it is applied topically
in combination with the quince or the strutheum.<a id="FNanchor_2317_2317"></a><a href="#Footnote_2317_2317" class="fnanchor">2317</a> It
dispels the fumes of wine also, and difficulties of breathing<a id="FNanchor_2318_2318"></a><a href="#Footnote_2318_2318" class="fnanchor">2318</a>
and taken in doses of two oboli it acts as an emetic: applied
as a plaster with honey, it extracts splinters of broken bones.
Powdered iris is employed also for whitlows, and, mixed with
wine, for corns and warts, in which case it is left for three days
on the part affected.</p>

<p>Chewed, it is a corrective of bad breath and offensive exhalations
of the arm-pits, and the juice of it softens all kinds of
indurations of the body. This plant acts as a soporific, but it
wastes the seminal fluids: it is used also for the treatment of
chaps of the fundament and condylomata, and it heals all sorts
of excrescences on the body.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>Some persons give the name of “xyris”<a id="FNanchor_2319_2319"></a><a href="#Footnote_2319_2319" class="fnanchor">2319</a> to the wild iris.
This plant disperses scrofulous sores, as well as tumours and
inguinal swellings; but it is generally recommended that when
wanted for these purposes it should be pulled up with the left
hand, the party gathering it mentioning the name of the patient
and of the disease for which it is intended to be employed.
While speaking of this subject, I will take the opportunity of
disclosing the criminal practices of some herbalists—they
keep back a portion of the iris, and of some other plants as
well, the plantago for instance, and, if they think that they
have not been sufficiently well paid and wish to be employed
a second time, bury the part they have kept back in the same
place; their object being, I suppose,<a id="FNanchor_2320_2320"></a><a href="#Footnote_2320_2320" class="fnanchor">2320</a> to revive the malady
which has just been cured.</p>

<p>The root of the saliunca<a id="FNanchor_2321_2321"></a><a href="#Footnote_2321_2321" class="fnanchor">2321</a> boiled in wine, arrests vomiting

all over with polium,<a id="FNanchor_2322_2322"></a><a href="#Footnote_2322_2322" class="fnanchor">2322</a> and handle and cultivate it as much
as possible. They say, too, that it should be kept about the
person as an antidote to poison, and that to keep serpents away it
should be strewed beneath the bed, burnt, or else carried on the
person; decoctions of it in wine, either fresh-gathered or dried,
should be used too as a liniment for the body. Medical men
prescribe it in vinegar for affections of the spleen, and in wine
for the jaundice; a decoction of it in wine is recommended
also for incipient dropsy; and in this way too, it is employed as a
liniment for wounds. This plant has the effect of bringing
away the after-birth and the dead fœtus, and of dispelling
pains in various parts of the body: it empties the bladder also,
and is employed in liniments for defluxions of the eyes. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
there is no plant known that better deserves to form an
ingredient in the medicament known to us as the “alexipharmacon:”<a id="FNanchor_2323_2323"></a><a href="#Footnote_2323_2323" class="fnanchor">2323</a>
though there are some who say that it is injurious to
the stomach and is apt to stuff the head, and that it produces
abortion—assertions which<a id="FNanchor_2324_2324"></a><a href="#Footnote_2324_2324" class="fnanchor">2324</a> others, again, totally deny.</p>

<p>There is a superstitious observance also, to the effect that,
for cataract, it ought to be attached to the neck the moment
it is found, every precaution being taken not to let it touch the
ground. The same persons state too that the leaves of it are
similar to those of thyme, except that they are softer and more
white and downy. Beaten up with wild rue in rain water, it
is said to assuage the pain of the sting of the asp; it is quite
as astringent too as the flower<a id="FNanchor_2325_2325"></a><a href="#Footnote_2325_2325" class="fnanchor">2325</a> of the pomegranate, and as

or melitt&aelig;na, the bees will never desert them; for there is no
flower in which they take greater delight. If branches<a id="FNanchor_2329_2329"></a><a href="#Footnote_2329_2329" class="fnanchor">2329</a> of
this plant are used, the bees may be kept within bounds without
any difficulty. It is an excellent remedy, also, for the
stings of bees, wasps, and similar insects, as also for wounds
made by spiders and scorpions; it is used, too, for hysterical
suffocations, in combination with nitre, and for gripings of the
bowels, with wine. The leaves of it are employed topically
for scrofulous sores, and, in combination with salt, for maladies
of the fundament. A decoction of the juice promotes the menstrual
discharge, dispels inflammations, and heals ulcerous
sores: it is good, too, for diseases of the joints and the bites
of dogs, and is beneficial in cases of inveterate dysentery, and
for cœliac affections, hardness of breathing, diseases of the
spleen, and ulcerations of the thoracic organs. For films on
the eyes, it is considered a most excellent plan to anoint them
with the juice of this plant mixed with honey.</p>

else linseed, effects the cure of diseases of the eyes. It assuages
pains, too, in the jaws and head, applied with rose oil; and,
employed with raisin wine, it is good for pains in the ears, and
all kinds of swellings or eruptions on the hands. A decoction
of it in wine, or else the plant itself beaten up raw, is good
for pains in the stomach. It is equally beneficial, too, for
maladies of the uterus; and for diseases of the testes, prolapsus
of the fundament, and all other diseases of those parts, a decoction
is made of it, fresh-gathered, in water or in raisin wine.
With the addition of rose oil, it is used as a liniment for carcinoma.

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_88"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 88. (21.)—FOUR REMEDIES DERIVED PROM TREFOIL.</span></h3></div>

<p>The trefoil,<a id="FNanchor_2332_2332"></a><a href="#Footnote_2332_2332" class="fnanchor">2332</a> I know, is generally looked upon as being particularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
good for the stings of serpents and scorpions, the seed
being taken in doses of twenty grains, with either wine or
oxycrate; or else the leaves and the plant itself are boiled together,
and a decoction made of them; indeed, it is stated, that
a serpent is never to be seen among trefoil. Celebrated authors,
too, I find, have asserted that twenty-five grains of the seed of
the kind of trefoil which we have<a id="FNanchor_2333_2333"></a><a href="#Footnote_2333_2333" class="fnanchor">2333</a> spoken of as the “minyanthes,”
are a sufficient antidote for all kinds of poisons: in addition
to which, there are numerous other remedial virtues
ascribed to it.</p>

<p>But these notions, in my opinion, are counterbalanced by
the authority of a writer of the very highest repute: for we
find the poet Sophocles asserting that the trefoil is a venomous
plant. Simus, too, the physician, maintains that a decoction
of it, or the juice, poured upon the human body, is productive
of burning sensations similar to those experienced by persons
when they have been stung by a serpent and have trefoil applied
to the wound. It is my opinion, then, that trefoil should
never be used in any other capacity than as a counter-poison;
for it is not improbable that the venom of this plant has a
natural antipathy to all other kinds of poisons, a ph&aelig;nomenon
which has been observed in many other cases as well. I find
it stated, also, that the seed of the trefoil with an extremely
diminutive leaf, applied in washes to the face, is extremely
beneficial for preserving the freshness of the skin in females.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_89"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 89.—TWENTY-EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THYME.</span></h3></div>

<p>Thyme<a id="FNanchor_2334_2334"></a><a href="#Footnote_2334_2334" class="fnanchor">2334</a> should be gathered while it is in flower, and dried
in the shade. There are two kinds of thyme: the white thyme
with a ligneous root, which grows upon declivities, and is the
most esteemed of the two, and another variety, which is of a
darker colour, and bears a swarthy flower. They are, both of
them, considered to be extremely beneficial to the sight, whether
used as an article of food or as a medicament, and to be
good for inveterate coughs. Used as an electuary, with vinegar
and salt, they facilitate expectoration, and taken with
honey, they prevent the blood from coagulating. Applied externally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
with mustard, they dispel chronic fluxes of the fauces,
as well as various affections of the stomach and bowels. Still,
however, these plants must be used in moderation, as they are
of a heating nature, for which reason it is that they act so
astringently upon the bowels. In cases of ulceration of the
intestines, the dose should be one denarius of thyme to one
sextarius of oxymel; the same proportions, too, should be taken
for pains in the sides, between the shoulder-blades, or in the
thoracic organs. Taken with oxymel, these plants are used for
the cure of intestinal diseases, and a similar draught is administered
in cases of alienation of the senses and melancholy.</p>

<p>Thyme is given also for epilepsy, when the fits come on, the
smell of it reviving the patient; it is said, too, that epileptic
persons should sleep upon soft thyme. It is good, also, for
hardness of breathing, and for asthma and obstructions of the
catamenia. A decoction of thyme in water, boiled down to
one-third, brings away the dead fœtus, and it is given to males
with oxymel, as a remedy for flatulency, and in cases of swelling
of the abdomen or testes and of pains in the bladder. Applied
with wine, it removes tumours and fluxes, and, in combination
with vinegar, callosities and warts. Mixed with wine,
it is used as an external application for sciatica; and, beaten
up with oil and sprinkled upon wool, it is employed for diseases
of the joints, and for sprains. It is applied, also, to burns,
mixed with hogs’ lard. For maladies of the joints of recent
date, thyme is administered in drink, in doses of three oboli to
three cyathi of oxymel. For loss of appetite, it is given, beaten
up with salt.</p>

from the tears of Helena, is generally thought to have been
produced for improving the appearance, and to maintain unimpaired
the freshness of the skin in females, both of the face
and of other parts of the body. Besides this, it is generally
supposed that the use of it confers additional graces on the
person, and ensures universal attraction. They say, too, that,
taken with wine, it promotes gaiety of spirit, having, in fact, a
similar effect to the nepenthes, which has been so much vaunted
by Homer,<a id="FNanchor_2337_2337"></a><a href="#Footnote_2337_2337" class="fnanchor">2337</a> as producing forgetfulness of all sorrow. The
juice of this plant is remarkably sweet, and the root of it, taken
fasting in water, is good for hardness of breathing; it is white
within, and sweet. An infusion of it is taken in wine for the
stings of serpents; and the plant, bruised, it is said, will kill
mice.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_92"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 92.—TWENTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE

<p>We find two varieties of abrotonum<a id="FNanchor_2338_2338"></a><a href="#Footnote_2338_2338" class="fnanchor">2338</a> mentioned, the field,
and the mountain kind; this last, it is generally understood,
is the female plant, the other the male. They are both of them
bitter, like wormwood. That of Sicily is the most esteemed,
and next to it, that of Galatia. The leaves of it are sometimes
employed, but it is the seed that possesses the most warming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>
properties; hence it is, that it is so beneficial for maladies of
the sinews,<a id="FNanchor_2339_2339"></a><a href="#Footnote_2339_2339" class="fnanchor">2339</a> for cough, hardness of breathing, convulsions, ruptures,
lumbago, and strangury. Several handfuls of this plant
are boiled down to one-third, and the decoction of it, in doses
of four cyathi, is administered in drink. The seed is given,
pounded, in water, in doses of one drachma; it is very good
for affections of the uterus.</p>

<p>Mixed with barley-meal, this plant brings tumours to a
head, and boiled with quinces, it is employed as a liniment for
inflammations of the eyes. It keeps away serpents, and for
their stings it is either taken in wine, or else employed in
combination with it as a liniment. It is extremely efficacious,
also, for the stings of those noxious insects by which shivering
fits and chills are produced, such as the scorpion and the spider
called “phalangium,”<a id="FNanchor_2340_2340"></a><a href="#Footnote_2340_2340" class="fnanchor">2340</a> for example; taken in a potion, it is
good for other kinds of poison, as also for shivering fits, however
produced, and for the extraction of foreign substances adhering
to the flesh; it has the effect, also, of expelling intestinal
worms. It is stated that a sprig of this plant, if put beneath
the pillow, will act as an aphrodisiac, and that it is of
the very greatest efficacy against all those charms and spells by
which impotence is produced.</p>

Cyprus being the most highly esteemed, and possessed of the
finest smell—is a remedy for the stings of scorpions, applied
to the wound with vinegar and salt. Used as a pessary, too,
it is very beneficial in cases of menstrual derangement; but
when taken in drink, its properties are not so powerfully developed.
Used with polenta, it heals defluxions of the eyes;
and the juice of it, boiled, dispels gripings of the stomach. It
is useful, too, for strangury and dropsy; and in a dry state, it
promotes sneezing. There is an oil extracted from it, known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
as “sampsuchinum,” or “amaracinum,” which is very good
for warming and softening the sinews; it has a warming effect,
also, upon the uterus. The leaves are good for bruises, beaten
up with honey, and, mixed with wax, for sprains.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_94"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 94. (23.)—TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ANEMONE OR
PHRENION.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have as yet spoken<a id="FNanchor_2343_2343"></a><a href="#Footnote_2343_2343" class="fnanchor">2343</a> only of the anemone used for making
chaplets; we will now proceed to describe those kinds which
are employed for medicinal purposes. Some persons give the
name of “phrenion” to this plant: there are two species of
it; one of which is wild,<a id="FNanchor_2344_2344"></a><a href="#Footnote_2344_2344" class="fnanchor">2344</a> and the other grows on cultivated<a id="FNanchor_2345_2345"></a><a href="#Footnote_2345_2345" class="fnanchor">2345</a>
spots; though they are, both of them, attached to a sandy
soil. Of the cultivated anemone there are numerous varieties;
some, and these are the most abundant, have a scarlet flower,
while others, again, have a flower that is purple or else milk-white.
The leaves of all these three kinds bear a strong resemblance
to parsley, and it is not often that they exceed half
a foot in height, the head being very similar to that of asparagus.
The flower never opens, except while the wind is
blowing, a circumstance to which it owes its name.<a id="FNanchor_2346_2346"></a><a href="#Footnote_2346_2346" class="fnanchor">2346</a> The wild
anemone is larger than the cultivated one, and has broader
leaves, with a scarlet flower.</p>

<p>Some persons erroneously take the wild anemone to be the
same as the argemone,<a id="FNanchor_2347_2347"></a><a href="#Footnote_2347_2347" class="fnanchor">2347</a> while others, again, identify it with
the poppy which we have mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2348_2348"></a><a href="#Footnote_2348_2348" class="fnanchor">2348</a> under the name of
“rhœas:” there is, however, a great difference between them,
as these two other plants blossom later than the anemone, nor
does the anemone possess a juice or a calyx like theirs; besides
which, it terminates in a head like that of asparagus.</p>

<p>The various kinds of anemone are good for pains and inflammations
of the head, diseases of the uterus, and stoppage
of the milk in females; taken, too, in a ptisan, or applied as a
pessary in wool, they promote the menstrual discharge. The
root, chewed, has a tendency to bring away the phlegm, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
is a cure for tooth-ache: a decoction of it is good, too, for
defluxions of the eyes,<a id="FNanchor_2349_2349"></a><a href="#Footnote_2349_2349" class="fnanchor">2349</a> and effaces the scars left by wounds.
The Magi have attributed many very wonderful properties to
these plants: they recommend it to be gathered at the earliest
moment in the year that it is seen, and certain words to be
repeated, to the effect that it is being gathered as a remedy for
tertian and quartan fevers; after which the flower must be
wrapped up in red cloth and kept in the shade, in order to be
attached to the person when wanted. The root of the anemone
with a scarlet flower, beaten up and applied to the body
of any animated being,<a id="FNanchor_2350_2350"></a><a href="#Footnote_2350_2350" class="fnanchor">2350</a> produces an ulcer there by the agency
of its acrid qualities; hence it is that it is so much employed
as a detergent for ulcerous sores.</p>

It has small, white branches, with leaves of a
whitish colour, similar to those of the abrotonum. The clusters,
disposed around it, and glistening like gold in the rays of the
sun, are never known to fade; hence it is that they make
chaplets of it for the gods, a custom which was most faithfully
observed by Ptolem&aelig;us, the king of Egypt. This plant grows
in shrubberies: taken in wine, it acts as a diuretic and emmenagogue,
and, in combination with honey, it is employed topically
for burns. It is taken also in potions for the stings of
serpents, and for pains in the loins; and, with honied wine, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
removes coagulated blood in the abdominal regions and the
bladder. The leaves of it, beaten up and taken in doses of
three oboli, in white wine, arrest the menstrual discharge
when in excess.</p>

<p>The smell of this plant is far from disagreeable, and hence
it is kept with clothes, to protect them from the attacks of
vermin.</p>

wild variety, however, is prejudicial to the stomach. It acts
as a laxative to the bowels; and, taken in doses of two
drachm&aelig;, is remarkably efficacious for carrying off the bile.
So extremely baneful is it to scorpions, that if they so much

smell of an apple, with a bitter taste. With the decoction of
it, fomentations are made for maladies of the fundament, and
for inflammations and indurations of the uterus: dried and
applied with honey and vinegar, it carries off black bile, for
which reason it is considered good for vertigo and calculus in
the bladder. It is employed as a liniment, also, for erysipelas,
and, mixed with stale axle-grease, for scrofulous sores.
For tertian fevers the Magi recommend that it should be
taken up with the left hand, it being mentioned at the time
for whom it is gathered, care being also taken not to look back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
while doing so: a leaf of it should be laid beneath the patient’s
tongue, after which it must be eaten in a cyathus of water.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXI_CHAP_105"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 105. (31.)—EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE TRYCHNUM
OR STRYCHNUM, HALICACABUM, CALLIAS, DORCYNION,
MANICON, NEURAS, MORIO, OR MOLY.</span></h3></div>

<p>The trychnon<a id="FNanchor_2369_2369"></a><a href="#Footnote_2369_2369" class="fnanchor">2369</a> is by some called “strychnon;” I only wish
that the garland-makers of Egypt would never use this plant
in making their chaplets, being deceived as they are by the
resemblance in the leaves of both kinds to those of ivy. One
of these kinds, bearing scarlet berries with a stone, enclosed
in follicules, is by some persons called the “halicacabum,”<a id="FNanchor_2370_2370"></a><a href="#Footnote_2370_2370" class="fnanchor">2370</a> by
others the “callion,” and by the people of our country, the
“vesicaria,” from the circumstance of its being highly beneficial
to the bladder<a id="FNanchor_2371_2371"></a><a href="#Footnote_2371_2371" class="fnanchor">2371</a> and in cases of calculus.</p>

<p>The trychnon is more of a woody shrub than a herb, with
large follicules, broad and turbinated, and a large berry within,
which ripens in the month of November. A third<a id="FNanchor_2372_2372"></a><a href="#Footnote_2372_2372" class="fnanchor">2372</a> kind,
again, has a leaf resembling that of ocimum—but it is not my
intention to give an exact description of it, as I am here speaking
of remedies, and not of poisons; for a few drops of the
juice, in fact, are quite sufficient to produce insanity. The
Greek writers, however, have even turned this property into
matter for jesting; for, according to them, taken in doses of
one drachma, this plant is productive of delusive and prurient
fancies, and of vain, fantastic visions, which vividly present all
the appearance of reality: they say, too, that if the dose is
doubled, it will produce downright madness, and that any further
addition to it, will result in instant death.</p>

<p>This is the same plant which the more well-meaning writers
have called in their innocence “dorycnion,”<a id="FNanchor_2373_2373"></a><a href="#Footnote_2373_2373" class="fnanchor">2373</a> from the circumstance
that weapons used in battle are poisoned with it—for it
grows everywhere—while others, again, who have treated of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
more at length,<a id="FNanchor_2374_2374"></a><a href="#Footnote_2374_2374" class="fnanchor">2374</a> have given it the surname of “manicon.”<a id="FNanchor_2375_2375"></a><a href="#Footnote_2375_2375" class="fnanchor">2375</a>
Those, on the other hand, who have iniquitously concealed its
real qualities, give it the name of “erythron” or “neuras,”
and others “perisson”—details, however, which need not be
entered into more fully, except for the purpose of putting
persons upon their guard.</p>

<p>There is another kind, again, also called “halicacabum,”
which possesses narcotic qualities, and is productive of death
even more speedily than opium: by some persons it is called
“morio,” and by others “moly.”<a id="FNanchor_2376_2376"></a><a href="#Footnote_2376_2376" class="fnanchor">2376</a> It has, however, been
highly extolled by Diocles and Evenor, and, indeed, Timaristus
has gone so far as to sing its praises in verse. With a wonderful
obliviousness of remedies really harmless, they tell us, forsooth,
that it is an instantaneous remedy for loose teeth to
rinse them with halicacabum steeped in wine: but at the same
time they add the qualification that it must not be kept in the
mouth too long, or else delirium will be the result. This, however,
is pointing out remedies with a vengeance, the employment
of which will be attended with worse results than the
malady itself.</p>

<p>There is a third kind<a id="FNanchor_2377_2377"></a><a href="#Footnote_2377_2377" class="fnanchor">2377</a> of halicacabum, that is esteemed as an
article of food; but even though the flavour of it may be preferred
to garden plants, and although Xenocrates assures us that
there is no bodily malady for which the trychnos is not highly
beneficial, they are none of them so valuable as to make me
think it proper to speak more at length upon the subject, more
particularly as there are so many other remedies, which are
unattended with danger. Persons who wish to pass themselves
off for true prophets, and who know too well how to impose
upon the superstitions of others, take the root of the halicacabum
in drink. The remedy against this poison—and it is with
much greater pleasure that I state it—is to drink large quantities
of honied wine made hot. I must not omit the fact,
too, that this plant is naturally so baneful to the asp, that when
the root is placed near that reptile, the very animal which
kills others by striking them with torpor, is struck with torpor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
itself; hence it is, that, beaten up with oil, it is used as a cure
for the sting of the asp.</p>

<p>The corchorus<a id="FNanchor_2378_2378"></a><a href="#Footnote_2378_2378" class="fnanchor">2378</a> is a plant which is used at Alexandria as an
article of food: the leaves of it are rolled up, one upon the
other, like those of the mulberry, and it is wholesome, it is
said, for the viscera, and in cases of alopecy, being good also
for the removal of freckles. I find it stated also, that it cures
the scab in cattle very rapidly: and, according to Nicander,<a id="FNanchor_2379_2379"></a><a href="#Footnote_2379_2379" class="fnanchor">2379</a>
it is a remedy for the stings of serpents, if gathered before it

that it offers a most efficacious remedy for the stings of venomous
animals, as also in cases of poisoning by fungi. It is
a well-known fact, that persons, when stung by the scorpion,
are not sensible of any painful effects so long as they hold this
plant in their hand.</p>

when speaking of weights and measures,<a id="FNanchor_2382_2382"></a><a href="#Footnote_2382_2382" class="fnanchor">2382</a> I shall here
subjoin, once for all, some explanation of them.</p>

<p>The Attic drachma—for it is generally the Attic reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
that medical men employ—is much the same in weight as the
silver denarius, and is equivalent to six oboli, the obolus being
ten chalci; the cyathus is equal in weight to ten drachm&aelig;.
When the measure of an acetabulum is spoken of, it is the
same as one fourth part of a hemina, or fifteen drachm&aelig; in
weight. The Greek mna, or, as we more generally call it,
“mina,” equals one hundred Attic drachm&aelig; in weight.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Nature</span> and the earth might have well filled the measure of
our admiration, if we had nothing else to do but to consider
the properties enumerated in the preceding Book, and the numerous
varieties of plants that we find created for the wants
or the enjoyment of mankind. And yet, how much is there
still left for us to describe, and how many discoveries of a still
more astonishing nature! The greater part, in fact, of the
plants there mentioned recommend themselves to us by their
taste, their fragrance, or their beauty, and so invite us to
make repeated trials of their virtues: but, on the other hand,
the properties of those which remain to be described, furnish
us with abundant proof that nothing has been created by Nature
without some purpose to fulfil, unrevealed to us though it
may be.</p>

<p>I remark, in the first place, that there are some foreign nations
which, in obedience to long-established usage, employ
certain plants for the embellishment of the person. That,
among some barbarous peoples, the females<a id="FNanchor_2452_2452"></a><a href="#Footnote_2452_2452" class="fnanchor">2452</a> stain the face by
means of various plants, there can be little doubt, and among
the Daci and the Sarmat&aelig; we find the men even marking<a id="FNanchor_2453_2453"></a><a href="#Footnote_2453_2453" class="fnanchor">2453</a> their
bodies. There is a plant in Gaul, similar to the plantago in
appearance, and known there by the name of “glastum:”<a id="FNanchor_2454_2454"></a><a href="#Footnote_2454_2454" class="fnanchor">2454</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
with it both matrons and girls<a id="FNanchor_2455_2455"></a><a href="#Footnote_2455_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a> among the people of Britain
are in the habit of staining the body all over, when taking
part in the performance of certain sacred rites; rivalling
hereby the swarthy hue of the &AElig;thiopians, they go in a state
of nature.</p>

<p>We know, too, that from plants are extracted admirable
colours for dyeing; and, not to mention the berries<a id="FNanchor_2456_2456"></a><a href="#Footnote_2456_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> of Galatia,<a id="FNanchor_2457_2457"></a><a href="#Footnote_2457_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a>

They have not there to seek the murex at the bottom of the
sea, or to expose themselves to be the prey of the monsters of
the deep, while tearing it from their jaws, nor have they to go
searching in depths to which no anchor has penetrated—and
all this for the purpose of finding the means whereby some
mother of a family may appear more charming in the eyes of
her paramour, or the seducer may make himself more captivating
to the wife of another man. Standing on dry land, the
people there gather in their dyes just as we do our crops of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
corn—though one great fault in them is, that they wash<a id="FNanchor_2461_2461"></a><a href="#Footnote_2461_2461" class="fnanchor">2461</a> out;
were it not for which, luxury would have the means of bedecking
itself with far greater magnificence, or, at all events,
at the price of far less danger.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose, however, here to enter further into
these details, nor shall I make the attempt, by substituting
resources attended with fewer risks, to circumscribe luxury
within the limits of frugality; though, at the same time, I
shall have to speak on another occasion how that vegetable
productions are employed for staining stone and imparting
their colours to walls.<a id="FNanchor_2462_2462"></a><a href="#Footnote_2462_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a> Still, however, I should not have
omitted to enlarge upon the art of dyeing, had I found that it
had ever been looked upon as forming one of our liberal<a id="FNanchor_2463_2463"></a><a href="#Footnote_2463_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a> arts.
Meantime, I shall be actuated by higher considerations, and
shall proceed to show in what esteem we are bound to hold
the mute<a id="FNanchor_2464_2464"></a><a href="#Footnote_2464_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a> plants even, or in other words, the plants of little
note. For, indeed, the authors and founders of the Roman
sway have derived from these very plants even almost boundless
results; as it was these same plants, and no others, that
afforded them the “sagmen,”<a id="FNanchor_2465_2465"></a><a href="#Footnote_2465_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a> employed in seasons of public
calamity, and the “verbena” of our sacred rites and embassies.
These two names, no doubt, originally signified the same thing,—a
green turf torn up from the citadel with the earth attached
to it; and hence, when envoys were dispatched to the enemy
for the purpose of clarigation, or, in other words, with the
object of <i>clearly</i><a id="FNanchor_2466_2466"></a><a href="#Footnote_2466_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a> demanding restitution of property that had
been carried off, one of these officers was always known as
the “verbenarius.”<a id="FNanchor_2467_2467"></a><a href="#Footnote_2467_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 4. (3.)—THE GRASS CROWN: HOW RARELY IT HAS BEEN
AWARDED.</span></h3></div>

<p>Of all the crowns with which, in the days of its majesty,
the all-sovereign people, the ruler of the earth, recompensed
the valour of its citizens, there was none attended with higher
glory than the crown of grass.<a id="FNanchor_2468_2468"></a><a href="#Footnote_2468_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a> The crowns<a id="FNanchor_2469_2469"></a><a href="#Footnote_2469_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a> bedecked with
gems of gold, the vallar, mural, rostrate, civic, and triumphal
crowns, were, all of them, inferior to this: great, indeed, was
the difference between them, and far in the background were
they thrown by it. As to all the rest, a single individual
could confer them, a general or commander on his soldiers for
instance, or, as on some occasions, on his colleague: the senate,
too, exempt from the cares and anxieties of war, and the people
in the enjoyment of repose, could award them, together with
the honours of a triumph.</p>

<p>(4.) But as for the crown of grass, it was never conferred
except at a crisis of extreme desperation, never voted except
by the acclamation of the whole army, and never to any one
but to him who had been its preserver. Other crowns were
awarded by the generals to the soldiers, this alone by the
soldiers, and to the general. This crown is known also as the
“obsidional” crown, from the circumstance of a beleaguered
army being delivered, and so preserved from fearful disaster.
If we are to regard as a glorious and a hallowed reward the
civic crown, presented for preserving the life of a single citizen,
and him, perhaps, of the very humblest rank, what, pray, ought
to be thought of a whole army being saved, and indebted for its
preservation to the valour of a single individual?</p>

<p>The crown thus presented was made of green grass,<a id="FNanchor_2470_2470"></a><a href="#Footnote_2470_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a>
gathered on the spot where the troops so rescued had been
beleaguered. Indeed, in early times, it was the usual token of
victory for the vanquished to present to the conqueror a handful
of grass; signifying thereby that they surrendered<a id="FNanchor_2471_2471"></a><a href="#Footnote_2471_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a> their native
soil, the land that had nurtured them, and the very right
even there to be interred—a usage which, to my own knowledge,
still exists among the nations of Germany.<a id="FNanchor_2472_2472"></a><a href="#Footnote_2472_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_5"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 5. (5.)—THE ONLY PERSONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED
WITH THIS CROWN.</span></h3></div>

<p>L. Siccius Dentatus<a id="FNanchor_2473_2473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2473_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a> was presented with this crown but
once, though he gained as many as fourteen civic crowns, and
fought one hundred and twenty battles, in all of which he was
victorious—so rarely is it that an army has to thank a single
individual only for its preservation! Some generals, however,
have been presented with more than one of these crowns,
P. Decius Mus,<a id="FNanchor_2474_2474"></a><a href="#Footnote_2474_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a> the military tribune, for example, who received
one from his own army, and another from the troops
which he had rescued<a id="FNanchor_2475_2475"></a><a href="#Footnote_2475_2475" class="fnanchor">2475</a> when surrounded. He testified by an
act of devoutness in what high esteem he held such an honour
as this, for, adorned with these insignia, he sacrificed a white
ox to Mars, together with one hundred red oxen, which had
been presented to him by the beleaguered troops as the recompense
of his valour: it was this same Decius, who afterwards,
when consul, with Imperiosus<a id="FNanchor_2476_2476"></a><a href="#Footnote_2476_2476" class="fnanchor">2476</a> for his colleague, devoted his
life to secure victory to his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>This crown was presented also by the senate and people of
Rome—a distinction than which I know of nothing in existence
more glorious—to that same Fabius<a id="FNanchor_2477_2477"></a><a href="#Footnote_2477_2477" class="fnanchor">2477</a> who restored the
fortunes of Rome by avoiding a battle; not, however, on the
occasion when he preserved the master of the horse<a id="FNanchor_2478_2478"></a><a href="#Footnote_2478_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a> and his
army; for then it was deemed preferable by those who were
indebted to him for their preservation to present him with a
crown under a new title, that of “father.” The crown of
grass was, however, awarded to him, with that unanimity
which I have mentioned, after Hannibal had been expelled
from Italy; being the only crown, in fact, that has hitherto
been placed upon the head of a citizen by the hands of the
state itself, and, another remarkable distinction, the only one
that has ever been conferred by the whole of Italy united.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 6. (6.)—THE ONLY CENTURION THAT HAS BEEN THUS
HONOURED.
</span></h3></div>

<p>In addition to the persons already mentioned, the honour
of this crown has been awarded to M. Calpurnius Flamma,<a id="FNanchor_2479_2479"></a><a href="#Footnote_2479_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a>
then a military tribune in Sicily; but up to the present time
it has been given to a single centurion only, Cneius Petreius
Atinas, during the war with the Cimbri. This soldier, while
acting as primipilus<a id="FNanchor_2480_2480"></a><a href="#Footnote_2480_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a> under Catulus, on finding all retreat for
his legion cut off by the enemy, harangued the troops, and
after slaying his tribune who hesitated to cut a way through the
encampment of the enemy, brought away the legion in safety.
I find it stated also by some authors, that, in addition to this
honour, this same Petreius, clad in the pr&aelig;texta, offered sacrifice
at the altar, to the sound of the pipe,<a id="FNanchor_2481_2481"></a><a href="#Footnote_2481_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a> in presence of the
then consuls,<a id="FNanchor_2482_2482"></a><a href="#Footnote_2482_2482" class="fnanchor">2482</a> Marius and Catulus.</p>

<p>The Dictator Sylla has also stated in his memoirs, that when
legatus in the Marsic War he was presented with this crown
by the army, at Nola; an event which he caused to be commemorated
in a painting at his Tusculan villa, which afterwards
became the property of Cicero. If there is any truth
in this statement, I can only say that it renders his memory
all the more execrable, and that, by his proscriptions, with his
own hand he tore this crown from his brow, for few indeed
were the citizens whom he thus preserved, in comparison with
those he slaughtered at a later period. And let him even add
to this high honour his proud surname of “Felix,”<a id="FNanchor_2483_2483"></a><a href="#Footnote_2483_2483" class="fnanchor">2483</a> if he will;
all the glories of this crown he surrendered to Sertorius, from
the moment that he put his proscribed fellow-citizens in a
stage of siege throughout the whole world.</p>

<p>Varro, too, relates that Scipio &AElig;milianus was awarded the
obsidional crown in Africa, under the consul Manilius,<a id="FNanchor_2484_2484"></a><a href="#Footnote_2484_2484" class="fnanchor">2484</a> for the
preservation of three cohorts, by bringing as many to their
rescue; an event commemorated by an inscription upon the
base of the statue erected in honour of him by the now deified
Emperor Augustus, in the Forum which bears his name. Augustus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
himself was also presented by the senate with the obsidional
crown, upon the ides<a id="FNanchor_2485_2485"></a><a href="#Footnote_2485_2485" class="fnanchor">2485</a> of September, in the consulship<a id="FNanchor_2486_2486"></a><a href="#Footnote_2486_2486" class="fnanchor">2486</a>
of M. Cicero the Younger, the civic crown being looked upon
as not commensurate with his deserts. Beyond these, I do not
find any one mentioned as having been rewarded with this
honour.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_7"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 7.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM OTHER CHAPLET PLANTS.
</span></h3></div>

<p>No plant<a id="FNanchor_2487_2487"></a><a href="#Footnote_2487_2487" class="fnanchor">2487</a> in particular was employed in the composition of
this crown, such only being used as were found growing on
the spot so imperilled; and thus did they become the means,
however humble and unnoted themselves, of conferring high
honour and renown. All this, however, is but little known
among us at the present day; a fact which I am the less surprised
at, when I reflect that those plants even are treated
with the same indifference, the purpose of which it is to preserve
our health, to allay our bodily pains, and to repel the
advances of death! And who is there that would not visit
with censure, and justly visit, the manners of the present day?
Luxury and effeminacy have augmented the price at which
we live, and never was life more hankered after, or worse
cared<a id="FNanchor_2488_2488"></a><a href="#Footnote_2488_2488" class="fnanchor">2488</a> for, than it is at present. This, however, we look upon
as the business of others, forsooth; other persons must see to it,
without our troubling ourselves to request them, and the physicians
must exercise the necessary providence in our behalves.<a id="FNanchor_2489_2489"></a><a href="#Footnote_2489_2489" class="fnanchor">2489</a>
As for ourselves, we go on enjoying our pleasures, and are content
to live—a thing that in my opinion reflects the highest
possible disgrace—by putting faith in others.<a id="FNanchor_2490_2490"></a><a href="#Footnote_2490_2490" class="fnanchor">2490</a></p>

<p>Nay, even more than this, we ourselves are held in derision
by many, for undertaking these researches, and are charged
with busying ourselves with mere frivolities! It is some
solace, however, in the prosecution of these our boundless
labours, to have Nature as our sharer in this contempt: Nature
who, as we will prove beyond a doubt, has never failed
in coming to the assistance of man, and has implanted<a id="FNanchor_2491_2491"></a><a href="#Footnote_2491_2491" class="fnanchor">2491</a> remedies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
for our use in the most despised even of the vegetable productions,
medicaments in plants which repel us with their
thorns.</p>

<p>It is of these, in fact, that it remains for us now to speak, as
next in succession to those which we have mentioned in the
preceding Book; and here we cannot sufficiently admire, and,
indeed, adore,<a id="FNanchor_2492_2492"></a><a href="#Footnote_2492_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a> the wondrous providence displayed by Nature.
She had given us, as already<a id="FNanchor_2493_2493"></a><a href="#Footnote_2493_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a> shewn, plants soft to the touch,
and agreeable to the palate; in the flowers she had painted
the remedies for our diseases with her varied tints, and, while
commingling the useful with the delicious, had attracted our
attention by means of the pleasures of the eye. Here, however,
she has devised another class of plants, bristling and repulsive
to the sight, and dangerous to the touch; so much so,
indeed, that we fancy we all but hear the voice of her who
made them as she reveals to us her motives for so doing. It is
her wish, she says, that no ravening cattle may browse upon
them, that no wanton hand may tear them up, that no heedless
footstep may tread them down, that no bird, perching there,
may break them: and in thus fortifying them with thorns, and
arming them with weapons, it has been her grand object
to save and protect the remedies which they afford to man.
Thus we see, the very qualities even which we hold in such
aversion, have been devised by Nature for the benefit and advantage
of mankind.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_8"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 8. (7.)—THE ERYNGE OR ERYNGIUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>In the first rank of the plants armed with prickles, the
erynge<a id="FNanchor_2494_2494"></a><a href="#Footnote_2494_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a> or eryngion stands pre-eminent, a vegetable production
held in high esteem as an antidote formed for the poison of serpents
and all venomous substances. For stings and bites of
this nature, the root is taken in wine in doses of one drachma,
or if, as generally is the case, the wound is attended with
fever, in water. It is employed also, in the form of a liniment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>
for wounds, and is found to be particularly efficacious
for those inflicted by water-snakes or frogs. The physician
Heraclides states it as his opinion that, boiled in goose-broth,
it is a more valuable remedy than any other known, for aconite<a id="FNanchor_2495_2495"></a><a href="#Footnote_2495_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a>
and other poisons.<a id="FNanchor_2496_2496"></a><a href="#Footnote_2496_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a> Apollodorus recommends that, in
cases of poisoning, it should be boiled with a frog, and other
authorities, in water only. It is a hardy plant, having much
the appearance of a shrub, with prickly leaves and a jointed
stem; it grows a cubit or more in height. Sometimes it is
found of a whitish colour, and sometimes black,<a id="FNanchor_2497_2497"></a><a href="#Footnote_2497_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> the root of it
being odoriferous. It is cultivated in gardens, but it is frequently
to be found growing<a id="FNanchor_2498_2498"></a><a href="#Footnote_2498_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a> spontaneously in rugged and
craggy localities. It grows, too, on the sea-shore, in which case
it is tougher and darker than usual, the leaf resembling that of
parsley.<a id="FNanchor_2499_2499"></a><a href="#Footnote_2499_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a></p>

<p>The white variety of the eryngium is known in our language
as the “centum capita.”<a id="FNanchor_2500_2500"></a><a href="#Footnote_2500_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a> It has all the properties above-mentioned,

as an article of food,<a id="FNanchor_2501_2501"></a><a href="#Footnote_2501_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a> either boiled or raw. There are some
marvellous facts related in connexion with this plant; the root<a id="FNanchor_2502_2502"></a><a href="#Footnote_2502_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
of it, it is said, bears a strong resemblance to the organs of
either sex; it is but rarely found, but if a root resembling the
male organs should happen to fall in the way of a man, it
will ensure him woman’s love; hence it is that Phaon the
Lesbian was so passionately beloved<a id="FNanchor_2503_2503"></a><a href="#Footnote_2503_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a> by Sappho. Upon this
subject, too, there have been numerous other reveries, not only
on the part of the Magi, but of Pythagorean philosophers even
as well.</p>

<p>So far as its medicinal properties are concerned, in addition
to those already mentioned, this plant, taken in hydromel, is
good for flatulency, gripings of the bowels, diseases of the
heart, stomach, liver, and thoracic organs, and, taken in oxycrate,
for affections of the spleen. Mixed with hydromel, it is
recommended also for diseases of the kidneys, strangury, opisthotony,
spasms, lumbago, dropsy, epilepsy, suppression or excess of
the catamenia, and all maladies of the uterus. Applied with
honey, it extracts foreign substances from the body, and, with
salted axle-grease and cerate, it disperses scrofulous sores, imposthumes
of the parotid glands, inflamed tumours, denudations
of the bones, and fractures. Taken before drinking, it prevents
the fumes of wine from rising to the head, and it arrests
looseness of the bowels. Some of our authors have recommended
that this plant should be gathered at the period of
the summer solstice, and that it should be applied, in combination
with rain water, for all kinds of maladies of the neck.
They say too, that, attached as an amulet to the person, it is a
cure for albugo.<a id="FNanchor_2504_2504"></a><a href="#Footnote_2504_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a></p>

species of eryngium. It is a thorny plant, stunted, and
spreading, with prickles of a considerable size. Applied topically,
they say, it arrests h&aelig;morrhage in a most remarkable

to be a kind of eryngium: it will, therefore, be as well
to take this opportunity of making some further mention of it.
There can be no doubt, however, that this is one of the thorny
plants, the leaves of it being covered with prickles,<a id="FNanchor_2507_2507"></a><a href="#Footnote_2507_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a> substantial,
and viscous and gummy to the touch: it has much the
appearance of a shrub, is a couple of cubits in height, and
bears a flower like that of the hyacinth, and a fruit the size
of the little round balls<a id="FNanchor_2508_2508"></a><a href="#Footnote_2508_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a> of the plane. The best kind is that
grown in Cilicia, and the next best that of Pontus; the root
of it is sweet, and this is the only part that is used. It is
gathered at the setting of the Vergili&aelig;,<a id="FNanchor_2509_2509"></a><a href="#Footnote_2509_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a> the root of it being

of boxwood in fact, is superior to the darker kind, and
the flexible is better than the brittle. Boiled down to one-third,
it is employed for pessaries; but, for general purposes,
a decoction is made of it of the consistency of honey. Sometimes,
also, it is used pounded, and it is in this form that it is
applied as a liniment for wounds and all affections of the
throat. The juice<a id="FNanchor_2511_2511"></a><a href="#Footnote_2511_2511" class="fnanchor">2511</a> of it is also very good for the voice, for
which purpose it is thickened and then placed beneath the
tongue: it is good, too, for the chest and liver.</p>

<p>We have already stated<a id="FNanchor_2512_2512"></a><a href="#Footnote_2512_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a> that this plant has the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>
allaying hunger and thirst: hence it is that some authors
have given it the name of “adipsos,”<a id="FNanchor_2513_2513"></a><a href="#Footnote_2513_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a> and have prescribed it
for dropsical patients, to allay thirst. It is for this reason,
too, that it is chewed as a stomatic,<a id="FNanchor_2514_2514"></a><a href="#Footnote_2514_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a> and that the powder of it
is often sprinkled on ulcerous sores of the mouth and films<a id="FNanchor_2515_2515"></a><a href="#Footnote_2515_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a> on

the kidneys, condylomata,<a id="FNanchor_2517_2517"></a><a href="#Footnote_2517_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> and ulcerous sores of the genitals.
Some persons have given it in potions for quartan fevers, the

<p>The stœbe,<a id="FNanchor_2523_2523"></a><a href="#Footnote_2523_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a> by some persons known as the “pheos,” boiled

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_14"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 14. (12.)—TWO VARIETIES OF THE HIPPOPHAES: TWO
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The hippophaes<a id="FNanchor_2524_2524"></a><a href="#Footnote_2524_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a> grows in sandy soils, and on the sea-shore.
It is a plant with white thorns, and covered with clusters, like
the ivy, the berries being white, and partly red. The root of
it is full of a juice which is either used by itself, or else is made
up into lozenges with meal of fitches: taken in doses of one
obolus, it carries off bile, and it is extremely beneficial if
used with honied wine. There is another<a id="FNanchor_2525_2525"></a><a href="#Footnote_2525_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a> hippophaes, without
either stalk or flowers, and consisting only of diminutive
leaves: the juice of this also is wonderfully useful for dropsy.</p>

<p>These plants would appear, too, to be remarkably well
adapted to the constitution of the horse, as it can be for no
other reason than this that they have received their name.<a id="FNanchor_2526_2526"></a><a href="#Footnote_2526_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
For, in fact, there are certain plants which have been created
as remedies for the diseases of animals, the Divinity being
bounteously lavish of his succours and resources; so much
so, indeed, that we cannot sufficiently admire the wisdom with
which he has arranged them according to the classes of animated
beings which they are to serve, the causes which give
rise to their various maladies, and the times at which they are
likely to be in requisition: hence it is that there is no class
of beings, no season, and, so to speak, no day, that is without
its remedy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_15"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 15. (13.)—THE NETTLE: SIXTY-ONE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>What plant can there possibly be that is more an object of
our aversion than the nettle?<a id="FNanchor_2527_2527"></a><a href="#Footnote_2527_2527" class="fnanchor">2527</a> And yet, in addition to the
oil which we have already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2528_2528"></a><a href="#Footnote_2528_2528" class="fnanchor">2528</a> as being extracted from
it in Egypt, it abounds in medicinal properties. The seed of
it, according to Nicander, is an antidote to the poison of hemlock,<a id="FNanchor_2529_2529"></a><a href="#Footnote_2529_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a>
of fungi, and of quicksilver.<a id="FNanchor_2530_2530"></a><a href="#Footnote_2530_2530" class="fnanchor">2530</a> Apollodorus prescribes
it, too, taken in the broth of a boiled tortoise,<a id="FNanchor_2531_2531"></a><a href="#Footnote_2531_2531" class="fnanchor">2531</a> for the bite of
the salamander,<a id="FNanchor_2532_2532"></a><a href="#Footnote_2532_2532" class="fnanchor">2532</a> and as an antidote for the poison of henbane,
serpents, and scorpions. The stinging pungency even of the
nettle has its uses; for, by its contact, it braces the uvula, and
effects the cure of prolapsus of the uterus, and of procidence
of the anus in infants. By touching the legs of persons in a
lethargy, and the forehead more particularly, with nettles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
they are awakened.<a id="FNanchor_2533_2533"></a><a href="#Footnote_2533_2533" class="fnanchor">2533</a> Applied with salt, the nettle is used to
heal the bites of dogs, and beaten up and applied topically, it
arrests bleeding<a id="FNanchor_2534_2534"></a><a href="#Footnote_2534_2534" class="fnanchor">2534</a> at the nostrils, the root in particular. Mixed
with salt, also, it is employed for the cure of cancers and foul
ulcers; and, applied in a similar manner, it cures sprains and
inflamed tumours, as well as imposthumes of the parotid glands
and denudations of the bones. The seed of it, taken with
boiled must, dispels hysterical suffocations, and, applied topically,
it arrests mucous discharges of the nostrils. Taken with
hydromel, after dinner, in doses of two oboli, the seed produces
a gentle vomit;<a id="FNanchor_2535_2535"></a><a href="#Footnote_2535_2535" class="fnanchor">2535</a> and a dose of one obolus, taken in
wine, has the effect of dispelling lassitude. The seed is prescribed
also, parched, and in doses of one acetabulum, for
affections of the uterus; and, taken in boiled<a id="FNanchor_2536_2536"></a><a href="#Footnote_2536_2536" class="fnanchor">2536</a> must, it is a
remedy for flatulency of the stomach. Taken in an electuary,
with honey, it gives relief in hardness of breathing, and
clears the chest by expectoration: applied with linseed, it is a
cure for pains in the side, with the addition of some hyssop
and a little pepper. The seed is employed also in the form of
a liniment for affections of the spleen, and, parched and taken
with the food, it acts as a laxative in constipation of the bowels.
Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_2537_2537"></a><a href="#Footnote_2537_2537" class="fnanchor">2537</a> says that the seed, taken in drink, acts as a purgative
upon the uterus; and that taken, parched, with sweet
wine, in doses of one acetabulum, or applied externally with
juice of mallows, it alleviates pains in that organ. He
states also that, used with hydromel and salt, it expels intestinal
worms, and that a liniment made of the seed will restore
the hair when falling off. Many persons, too, employ the seed
topically, with old oil, for diseases of the joints, and for gout,
or else the leaves beaten up with bears’-grease: the root, too,
pounded in vinegar, is no less useful for the same purposes, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
also for affections of the spleen. Boiled in wine, and applied
with stale axle-grease and salt, the root disperses inflamed tumours,
and, dried, it is used as a depilatory.</p>

<p>Phanias, the physician, has enlarged upon the praises of the
nettle, and he assures us that, taken with the food, either
boiled or preserved, it is extremely beneficial for affections of
the trachea, cough, fluxes of the bowels, stomachic complaints,
inflamed tumours, imposthumes of the parotid glands, and chilblains;
that, taken with oil, it acts as a sudorific; and that,
boiled with shell-fish, it relaxes the bowels. He says, too,
that taken with a ptisan,<a id="FNanchor_2538_2538"></a><a href="#Footnote_2538_2538" class="fnanchor">2538</a> it facilitates expectoration and acts
as an emmenagogue, and that, applied with salt, it prevents
ulcers from spreading. The juice of the nettle is also used:
applied to the forehead, it arrests bleeding at the nose, taken
in drink it acts as a diuretic and breaks calculi in the bladder,
and, used as a gargle, it braces the uvula when relaxed.</p>

<p>Nettle-seed should be gathered at harvest-time: that of
Alexandria is the most highly esteemed. For all these different
purposes the milder and more tender plants are the
best, the wild nettle<a id="FNanchor_2539_2539"></a><a href="#Footnote_2539_2539" class="fnanchor">2539</a> in particular: this last, taken in wine,
has the additional property of removing leprous spots on the
face. When animals refuse to couple, it is recommended to
rub the sexual organs with nettles.<a id="FNanchor_2540_2540"></a><a href="#Footnote_2540_2540" class="fnanchor">2540</a></p>

as also for burns and scrofulous sores, tumours, gout, and
wounds. The middle of the leaf is white, and is used for
the cure of erysipelas. Some of our authors have distinguished
the various species of this plant according to their
respective seasons; thus, for instance, the root of the autumn
nettle, they say, carried on the person as an amulet, is a cure
for tertian fevers, if due care is taken, when pulling up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
root, to mention the patient’s name, and to state who he is and
who are his parents. They say, too, that this plant is productive
of similar results in quartan fever: and they pretend
that the root of the nettle, with the addition of salt, will extract
foreign substances from the body; and that the leaves,
mixed with stale axle-grease, will disperse scrofulous sores, or
if they suppurate, cauterize them and cause them to fill up
with new flesh.</p>

<p>The helxine<a id="FNanchor_2551_2551"></a><a href="#Footnote_2551_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a> is called by some, “perdicium,” from the circumstance

Other persons, however, give it the name of “sideritis,” and
to some it is known as “parthenium.” It has leaves, the
shape of which is a mixture of those of the plantago and the
marrubium;<a id="FNanchor_2553_2553"></a><a href="#Footnote_2553_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> the stalks are slight and closely packed, and are

those of the lappa,<a id="FNanchor_2554_2554"></a><a href="#Footnote_2554_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> adhere to the clothes, a circumstance, it is
said, to which it owes its name<a id="FNanchor_2555_2555"></a><a href="#Footnote_2555_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a> of “helxine.” We have
already stated in the preceding Book<a id="FNanchor_2556_2556"></a><a href="#Footnote_2556_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a> what are the characteristics

The leaf of it is similar to that of ocimum, but
darker, and it is found growing on tiled roofs and walls.
Beaten up with a sprinkling of salt, it has all the medicinal
properties of the lamium,<a id="FNanchor_2562_2562"></a><a href="#Footnote_2562_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a> and is used in a similar manner.
The juice of it, taken warm, is good, too, for suppurated abscesses;
but for the cure of convulsions, ruptures, bruises,
and the effects of falls from a height, or of the overturning of
vehicles, it is possessed of singular virtues.</p>

<p>A slave, who was held in high esteem by Pericles,<a id="FNanchor_2563_2563"></a><a href="#Footnote_2563_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a> the ruler

has a rougher leaf than the other, and creeps along the ground,
erecting its prickles like the quills of a hedgehog; the root of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>
it is sweet, and the odour very powerful. In some places
it secretes, just as they say incense<a id="FNanchor_2567_2567"></a><a href="#Footnote_2567_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a> is produced, a white viscous
substance beneath the axils of the leaves, about the rising
of the Dog-star more particularly. To this viscous nature it
owes its name of “ixias;”<a id="FNanchor_2568_2568"></a><a href="#Footnote_2568_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a> females<a id="FNanchor_2569_2569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2569_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a> make use of it as a substitute
for mastich. As to its name of “cham&aelig;leon,”<a id="FNanchor_2570_2570"></a><a href="#Footnote_2570_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a> that
is given to it from the varying tints of the leaves; for it
changes its colours, in fact, just according to the soil, being
black in one place, green in another, blue in a third, yellow
elsewhere, and of various other colours as well.</p>

<p>A decoction of the root of the white cham&aelig;leon is employed
for the cure<a id="FNanchor_2571_2571"></a><a href="#Footnote_2571_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a> of dropsy, being taken in doses of one
drachma in raisin wine. This decoction, taken in doses of
one acetabulum, in astringent wine, with some sprigs of origanum
in it, has the effect of expelling intestinal worms: it is
good, too, as a diuretic. Mixed with polenta, the juice of it
will kill dogs and swine; with the addition of water and oil,
it will attract mice to it and destroy<a id="FNanchor_2572_2572"></a><a href="#Footnote_2572_2572" class="fnanchor">2572</a> them, unless they immediately
drink water to counteract its effects. Some persons
recommend the root of it to be kept, cut in small pieces, and
suspended from the ceiling; when wanted, it must be boiled
and taken with the food, for the cure of those fluxes to which
the Greeks have given the name of “rheumatismi.”<a id="FNanchor_2573_2573"></a><a href="#Footnote_2573_2573" class="fnanchor">2573</a></p>

<p>In reference to the dark kind, some writers say that the one
which bears a purple flower is the male, and that with a violet
flower, the female. They grow together, upon a stem, a cubit
in length, and a finger in thickness. The root of these plants,
boiled with sulphur and bitumen, is employed for the cure of
lichens; and they are chewed, or a decoction of them made
in vinegar, to fasten loose teeth. The juice of them is employed
for the cure of scab in animals, and it has the property
of killing ticks upon dogs. Upon steers it takes effect like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
sort of quinsy; from which circumstance it has received the
name of “ulophonon”<a id="FNanchor_2574_2574"></a><a href="#Footnote_2574_2574" class="fnanchor">2574</a> from some, as also that of cynozolon<a id="FNanchor_2575_2575"></a><a href="#Footnote_2575_2575" class="fnanchor">2575</a>

It is more downy than the other plant, however, and not so
substantial; the leaves, too, are thinner, and more drooping.
The root of it, treated with oil, does not give out any red juice,
a sign by which it is distinguished from the genuine anchusa.
The leaves of this plant, or the seed, taken in drink, are extremely
efficacious for the stings of serpents; the leaves, too,
are applied topically to the wound; and the powerful smell of
them will keep serpents at a distance. A preparation of this
plant is taken, also, as a potion, for affections of the vertebr&aelig;.
The Magi recommend that the leaves of it should be plucked

<p>There is another plant, too, the proper name of which is
“onochilon,”<a id="FNanchor_2583_2583"></a><a href="#Footnote_2583_2583" class="fnanchor">2583</a> but which some people call “anchusa,” others
“archebion,” and others, again, “onochelis,” or “rhexia,”
and, more universally, “enchrysa.” This plant has a diminutive
stem, a purple flower, rough leaves and branches, and a
root the colour of blood at harvest-time, though dark and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
swarthy at other times. It grows in sandy soils, and is extremely
efficacious for the stings of serpents, vipers in particular,
the roots or leaves of it being taken indifferently with the
food, or in the drink. It developes its virtues at harvest-time,
more especially: the leaves of it, when bruised, have just the
smell of a cucumber. This plant is prescribed, in doses of
three cyathi, for prolapsus of the uterus, and, taken with hyssop,
it expels tape-worms. For pains in the liver or kidneys,
it is taken in hydromel, if the patient shows symptoms of fever,
but if not, in wine. With the root of it a liniment is made,
for the removal of freckles and leprous sores; and it is asserted
that persons who carry this root about them will never be attacked
by serpents.</p>

<p>There is another<a id="FNanchor_2584_2584"></a><a href="#Footnote_2584_2584" class="fnanchor">2584</a> plant, again, very similar to this, with a
red flower, and somewhat smaller. It is applied to the same
uses as the other; it is asserted, too, that if it is chewed, and
then spit out upon a serpent, it will cause its instantaneous
death.</p>

CHAM&AElig;MELUM, OR MELANTHIUM; THREE VARIETIES OF IT:
ELEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The anthemis has been highly extolled by Asclepiades.
Some persons call it “leucanthemis,”<a id="FNanchor_2585_2585"></a><a href="#Footnote_2585_2585" class="fnanchor">2585</a> some leucanthemum,
others, again, “eranthemis,”<a id="FNanchor_2586_2586"></a><a href="#Footnote_2586_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> from its flowering in spring, and
others “cham&aelig;melon,”<a id="FNanchor_2587_2587"></a><a href="#Footnote_2587_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a> because it has a smell like that of an
apple: sometimes, too, it is called “melanthion.”<a id="FNanchor_2588_2588"></a><a href="#Footnote_2588_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> There are
three varieties of this plant, which only differ from one another
in the flower; they do not exceed a palm in height, and they
bear small blossoms like those of rue, white, yellow,<a id="FNanchor_2589_2589"></a><a href="#Footnote_2589_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a> or purple.</p>

<p>This plant is mostly found in thin, poor soils, or growing
near foot-paths. It is usually gathered in spring, and put by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>
for the purpose of making chaplets. At the same season, too,
medical men pound the leaves, and make them up into lozenges,
the same being done with the flowers also, and the root. All
the parts of this plant are administered together, in doses of one
drachma, for the stings of serpents of all kinds. Taken in drink,
too, they bring away the dead fœtus, act as an emmenagogue
and diuretic, and disperse calculi of the bladder. The anthemis
is employed, also, for the cure of flatulency, affections of
the liver, excessive secretions of the bile, and fistulas of the
eye; chewed, it heals running sores. Of all the different
varieties, the one that is most efficacious for the treatment of
calculi is that with the purple flower,<a id="FNanchor_2590_2590"></a><a href="#Footnote_2590_2590" class="fnanchor">2590</a> the leaves and stem<a id="FNanchor_2591_2591"></a><a href="#Footnote_2591_2591" class="fnanchor">2591</a> of
which are somewhat larger than those of the other kinds.
Some persons, and with strict propriety, give to this last the
name of “eranthemis.”</p>

for that poet names the lotus first of all among the herbs which

which resembles millet, the shepherds in Egypt make a coarse
bread, which they mostly knead with water or milk. It is
said, however, that there is nothing lighter or more wholesome
than this bread, so long as it is eaten warm; but that when it
gets cold, it becomes heavy and more difficult of digestion.
It is a well-known fact, that persons who use it as a diet are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
never attacked by dysentery, tenesmus, or other affections of
the bowels; hence it is, that this plant is reckoned among the
remedies for that class of diseases.</p>

TWELVE REMEDIES. THE HELIOTROPIUM, TRICOCCUM, OR SCORPIURON:
FOURTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have spoken more than once<a id="FNanchor_2596_2596"></a><a href="#Footnote_2596_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a> of the marvels of the heliotropium,
which turns<a id="FNanchor_2597_2597"></a><a href="#Footnote_2597_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a> with the sun, in cloudy weather even,
so great is its sympathy with that luminary. At night, as
though in regret, it closes its blue flower.</p>

<p>There are two species of heliotropium, the tricoccum<a id="FNanchor_2598_2598"></a><a href="#Footnote_2598_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a> and
the helioscopium,<a id="FNanchor_2599_2599"></a><a href="#Footnote_2599_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a> the latter being the taller of the two,
though they neither of them exceed half<a id="FNanchor_2600_2600"></a><a href="#Footnote_2600_2600" class="fnanchor">2600</a> a foot in height. The
helioscopium throws out branches from the root, and the seed
of it, enclosed in follicules,<a id="FNanchor_2601_2601"></a><a href="#Footnote_2601_2601" class="fnanchor">2601</a> is gathered at harvest-time. It
grows nowhere but in a rich soil, a highly-cultivated one more
particularly; the tricoccum, on the other hand, is to be found
growing everywhere. I find it stated, that the helioscopium,
boiled, is considered an agreeable food, and that taken in milk,
it is gently laxative<a id="FNanchor_2602_2602"></a><a href="#Footnote_2602_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a> to the bowels; while, again, a decoction of
it, taken as a potion, acts as a most effectual purgative. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
juice of this plant is collected in summer, at the sixth<a id="FNanchor_2603_2603"></a><a href="#Footnote_2603_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a> hour
of the day; it is usually mixed with wine, which makes<a id="FNanchor_2604_2604"></a><a href="#Footnote_2604_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> it
keep all the better. Combined with rose-oil, it alleviates
head-ache. The juice extracted from the leaves, combined
with salt, removes warts; from which circumstance our people
have given this plant the name of “verrucaria,”<a id="FNanchor_2605_2605"></a><a href="#Footnote_2605_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a> although,
from its various properties, it fully merits a better name. For,
taken in wine or hydromel, it is an antidote to the venom of
serpents and scorpions,<a id="FNanchor_2606_2606"></a><a href="#Footnote_2606_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a> as Apollophanes and Apollodorus state.
The leaves, too, employed topically, are a cure for the cerebral
affections of infants, known as “siriasis,”<a id="FNanchor_2607_2607"></a><a href="#Footnote_2607_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a> as also for convulsions,
even when they are epileptic. It is very wholesome,
too, to gargle the mouth with a decoction of this plant. Taken
in drink, it expels tapeworm and gravel, and, with the addition
of cummin, it will disperse calculi. A decoction of the plant
with the root, mixed with the leaves and some suet of a he-goat,
is applied topically for the cure of gout.</p>

<p>The other kind, which we have spoken<a id="FNanchor_2608_2608"></a><a href="#Footnote_2608_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a> of as being called
the “tricoccum,” and which also bears the name of “scorpiuron,”<a id="FNanchor_2609_2609"></a><a href="#Footnote_2609_2609" class="fnanchor">2609</a>
has leaves that are not only smaller than those of
the other kind, but droop downwards towards the ground: the
seed of it resembles a scorpion’s tail, to which, in fact, it owes
its latter appellation. It is of great efficacy for injuries received
from all kinds of venomous insects and the spider known as
the “phalangium,” but more particularly for the stings of
scorpions, if applied topically.<a id="FNanchor_2610_2610"></a><a href="#Footnote_2610_2610" class="fnanchor">2610</a> Those who carry it about their
person are never stung by a scorpion, and it is said that if a
circle is traced on the ground around a scorpion with a sprig
of this plant, the animal will never move out of it, and that if
a scorpion is covered with it, or even sprinkled with the water
in which it has been steeped, it will die that instant. Four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
grains of the seed, taken in drink, are said to be a cure for the
quartan fever, and three for the tertian; a similar effect being
produced by carrying the plant three times round the patient,
and then laying it under his head. The seed, too, acts as an
aphrodisiac, and, applied with honey, it disperses inflamed
tumours. This kind of heliotropium, as well as the other, extracts
warts radically,<a id="FNanchor_2611_2611"></a><a href="#Footnote_2611_2611" class="fnanchor">2611</a> and excrescences of the anus. Applied
topically, the seed draws off corrupt blood from the vertebr&aelig;
and loins; and a similar effect is produced by taking a decoction
of it in chicken broth, or with beet and lentils. The
husks<a id="FNanchor_2612_2612"></a><a href="#Footnote_2612_2612" class="fnanchor">2612</a> of the seed restore the natural colour to lividities of
the skin. According to the Magi, the patient himself should
make four knots in the heliotropium for a quartan, and three
for a tertian fever, at the same time offering a prayer that he
may recover to untie them, the plant being left in the ground
meanwhile.</p>

<p>Equally marvellous, too, in other respects, is the adiantum;<a id="FNanchor_2613_2613"></a><a href="#Footnote_2613_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a>
it is green in summer, never dies in the winter, manifests
an aversion to water, and, when sprinkled with water or
dipped in it, has all the appearance of having been dried, so
great is its antipathy to moisture; a circumstance to which it
owes the name of “adiantum,”<a id="FNanchor_2614_2614"></a><a href="#Footnote_2614_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a> given to it by the Greeks.
In other respects, it is a shrub which might be well employed
in ornamental gardening.<a id="FNanchor_2615_2615"></a><a href="#Footnote_2615_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a> Some persons give it the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>
“callitrichos,”<a id="FNanchor_2616_2616"></a><a href="#Footnote_2616_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a> and others of “polytrichos,” both of them
bearing reference to its property of imparting colour to the
hair. For this purpose, a decoction of it is made in wine
with parsley-seed, large quantities of oil being added, if it is
desired to make the hair thick and curly as well: it has also
the property of preventing the hair from coming off.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of this plant, one being whiter than
the other, which last is swarthy and more stunted. It is the
larger kind that is known as the “polytrichos,” or, as some
call it, the “trichomanes.” Both plants have tiny branches
of a bright black colour, and leaves like those of fern, the
lower ones being rough and tawny, and all of them lying close
together and attached to footstalks arranged on either side of
the stem: of root, so to say, there is nothing.<a id="FNanchor_2617_2617"></a><a href="#Footnote_2617_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a> This plant
frequents umbrageous rocks, walls sprinkled with the spray
of running water, grottoes of fountains more particularly, and
crags surrounded with streamlets, a fact that is all the more
remarkable in a plant which derives no benefit from water.</p>

<p>The adiantum is of singular efficacy in expelling and breaking
calculi of the bladder, the dark kind in particular; and it
is for this reason, in my opinion, rather than because it grows
upon stones, that it has received from the people of our
country its name of “saxifragum.”<a id="FNanchor_2618_2618"></a><a href="#Footnote_2618_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a> It is taken in wine, the
usual dose being a pinch of it in three fingers. Both these
plants are diuretics, and act as an antidote to the venom of serpents
and spiders: a decoction of them in wine arrests looseness
of the bowels. A wreath of them, worn on the head, alleviates
head-ache. For the bite of the scolopendra they are applied
topically, but they must be removed every now and then, to
prevent them from cauterizing the flesh:<a id="FNanchor_2619_2619"></a><a href="#Footnote_2619_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a> they are employed
in a similar manner also for alopecy.<a id="FNanchor_2620_2620"></a><a href="#Footnote_2620_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a> They disperse
scrofulous sores, scurf on the face, and running ulcers of the
head. A decoction of them is useful also for asthma, affections
of the liver and spleen, enlarged secretions of the gall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
and dropsy. In combination with wormwood, they form a
liniment for strangury and affections of the kidneys; they
have the effect also of bringing away the after-birth, and act
as an emmenagogue. Taken with vinegar or juice of bramble-berries,
they arrest h&aelig;morrhage. Combined with rose-oil
they are employed as a liniment for excoriations on infants,
the parts affected being first fomented with wine. The leaves,
steeped in the urine of a youth who has not arrived at puberty,
and beaten up with saltpetre, compose a liniment which, it is
said, prevents wrinkles from forming on the abdomen in
females. It is a general belief that partridges and cocks are
rendered more pugnacious if this plant is mixed with their
food; and it is looked upon as particularly beneficial for
cattle.</p>

<p>The picris<a id="FNanchor_2621_2621"></a><a href="#Footnote_2621_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a> derives its name from its intense bitterness, as

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_32"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 32.—THE ASPHODEL; FIFTY-ONE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The asphodel<a id="FNanchor_2623_2623"></a><a href="#Footnote_2623_2623" class="fnanchor">2623</a> is one of the most celebrated of all the plants,
so much so, indeed, that by some persons it has been called
“heroum.”<a id="FNanchor_2624_2624"></a><a href="#Footnote_2624_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a> Hesiod has mentioned the fact of its growing in
rivers, and Dionysius distinguishes it into male and female.<a id="FNanchor_2625_2625"></a><a href="#Footnote_2625_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a>
It has been observed that the bulbs of it, boiled with a ptisan,
are remarkably good for consumption and phthisis,<a id="FNanchor_2626_2626"></a><a href="#Footnote_2626_2626" class="fnanchor">2626</a> and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
bread in which they have been kneaded up with the meal, is
extremely wholesome. Nicander<a id="FNanchor_2627_2627"></a><a href="#Footnote_2627_2627" class="fnanchor">2627</a> recommends also, for the
stings of serpents and scorpions, either the stalk, which we
have already<a id="FNanchor_2628_2628"></a><a href="#Footnote_2628_2628" class="fnanchor">2628</a> spoken of under the name of “anthericus,” or
else the seed or bulbs, to be taken in wine, in doses of three
drachm&aelig;; and he says that these should be strewed beneath
the bed, if there is any apprehension of their presence. The
asphodel is prescribed also for wounds inflicted by marine
animals of a venomous nature, and the bite of the land scolopendra.
It is quite wonderful how the snails, in Campania,
seek the stalk of this plant, and dry it by extracting the
inside. The leaves, too, are applied with wine to wounds
made by venomous animals, and the bulbs are beaten up with
polenta and similarly used for affections of the sinews and
joints. It is also a very good plan to rub lichens with them
chopped up and mixed with vinegar, and to apply them in
water to putrid sores, as also to inflammations of the testes or
mamill&aelig;. Boiled in lees of wine, and applied in a linen pledget,
they are used for the cure of defluxions of the eyes.</p>

<p>Whatever the malady may happen to be, it is generally in
a boiled<a id="FNanchor_2629_2629"></a><a href="#Footnote_2629_2629" class="fnanchor">2629</a> state that the bulbs are employed; but for foul
ulcers of the legs and for chaps upon any part of the body,
they are dried and reduced to powder. The bulbs are usually
gathered in autumn,<a id="FNanchor_2630_2630"></a><a href="#Footnote_2630_2630" class="fnanchor">2630</a> a period when their medicinal properties
are most fully developed. The juice extracted from them
pounded, or else a decoction of them, is good, mixed with honey,
for pains in the body: it is employed also with dried iris and a
little salt by those who wish to impart an agreeable odour to
the person. The leaves are used for the cure of the various
maladies above mentioned, as also, boiled in wine, for scrofulous
sores, inflamed tumours, and ulcers of the face. The ashes
of the root are a remedy for alopecy and chaps on the feet;
and an extract of the root, boiled in oil, is good for burns and
chilblains. It is injected also into the ears for deafness, and,
for tooth-ache, it is poured into the ear opposite to the part
affected. A moderate dose of the root, taken in drink, acts as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
a diuretic and emmenagogue; it is good also for pains in the
sides, ruptures, convulsions, and coughs, in doses of one drachma,
taken in wine. Chewed, the root promotes vomiting, but the
seed, taken internally, disorders the bowels.</p>

<p>Chrysermus used to employ a decoction of the root, in wine,
for imposthumes of the parotid glands; and he has prescribed
it, in combination with cachrys,<a id="FNanchor_2631_2631"></a><a href="#Footnote_2631_2631" class="fnanchor">2631</a> in wine, for the cure of
scrofulous sores. Some persons say that if, after applying the
root to the sores, a part of it is hung up in the smoke to dry,
and not taken down till the end of four days, the sores
will gradually dry up with this portion of the root. Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_2632_2632"></a><a href="#Footnote_2632_2632" class="fnanchor">2632</a>
used to employ it both ways, boiled and raw, for the cure of
gout; and he prescribes it, boiled in oil, for chilblains, and,
in vinegar, for jaundice and dropsy. It has been stated,
also, that, used as a friction with wine and honey, or taken in
drink, it acts as an aphrodisiac. Xenocrates assures us, too,
that a decoction of the root in vinegar removes lichens, itch-scabs,
and leprous sores; and that a decoction of it, with henbane
and tar, has a similar effect, and is good also for the removal
of bad odours<a id="FNanchor_2633_2633"></a><a href="#Footnote_2633_2633" class="fnanchor">2633</a> of the armpits and thighs: he states,
also, that if the head is well rubbed with the root, being first
shaved, the hair will curl all the better for it. Simus prescribes
a decoction of it, in wine, to be taken for calculi in
the kidneys; and Hippocrates recommends the seed for obstructions
of the spleen. The root, or else a decoction of it,
applied topically, restores the hair in beasts of burden, where it
has been lost by ulcerations or scab. It has the effect, too, of
driving away rats and mice, and of exterminating them, if
placed before their holes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_33"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 33.—THE HALIMON: FOURTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Some authors have thought that it is the asphodel that is
called “halimon” by Hesiod, an opinion which appears to me
ill-founded; halimon<a id="FNanchor_2634_2634"></a><a href="#Footnote_2634_2634" class="fnanchor">2634</a> being the name of a distinct plant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
which has been the occasion of no few mistakes committed by
writers. According to some, it is a tufted shrub, white, destitute
of thorns, and with leaves like those of the olive, only
softer; which eaten boiled, are an agreeable food. The root,
they say, taken in doses of one drachma in hydromel, allays
gripings of the bowels, and is a cure for ruptures and convulsions.
Others, again, pronounce it to be a vegetable growing
near the sea-shore,<a id="FNanchor_2635_2635"></a><a href="#Footnote_2635_2635" class="fnanchor">2635</a> of a salt taste—to which, in fact, it
owes its name—with leaves somewhat round but elongated,
and much esteemed as an article of food. They say, too, that
there are two species of it, the wild and the cultivated,<a id="FNanchor_2636_2636"></a><a href="#Footnote_2636_2636" class="fnanchor">2636</a> and
that, mixed with bread, they are good, both of them, for dysentery,
even if ulceration should have supervened, and are
useful for stomachic affections, in combination with vinegar.
They state, also, that this plant is applied raw to ulcers of long
standing, and that it modifies the inflammation of recent
wounds, and the pain attendant upon sprains of the feet and
affections of the bladder. The wild halimon, they tell us,
has thinner leaves than the other, but is more effectual as a
medicament in all the above cases, as also for the cure of itch,
whether in man or beast. The root, too, according to them,
employed as a friction, renders the skin more clear, and the
teeth whiter; and they assert that if the seed of it is put
beneath the tongue, no thirst will be experienced. They
state, also, that this kind is eaten as well as the other, and that
they are, both of them, preserved.</p>

<p>Crateuas has spoken of a third<a id="FNanchor_2637_2637"></a><a href="#Footnote_2637_2637" class="fnanchor">2637</a> kind also, with longer
leaves than the others, and more hairy: it has the smell of
the cypress, he says, and grows beneath the ivy more particularly.
He states that this plant is extremely good for
opisthotony and contractions of the sinews, taken in doses of
three oboli to one sextarius of water.</p>

<p>The acanthus<a id="FNanchor_2638_2638"></a><a href="#Footnote_2638_2638" class="fnanchor">2638</a> is a plant that grows in cities, and is used

parterres in gardens.<a id="FNanchor_2639_2639"></a><a href="#Footnote_2639_2639" class="fnanchor">2639</a> There are two varieties of it; the one
that is thorny<a id="FNanchor_2640_2640"></a><a href="#Footnote_2640_2640" class="fnanchor">2640</a> and crisped is the shorter of the two; the

<p>The bupleuron<a id="FNanchor_2644_2644"></a><a href="#Footnote_2644_2644" class="fnanchor">2644</a> is reckoned by the Greeks in the number
of the leguminous plants which grow spontaneously. The
stem of it is a cubit in height, the leaves are long and numerous,
and the head resembles that of dill. It has been
extolled as an aliment by Hippocrates, and for its medicinal
properties by Glaucon and Nicander. The seed of it is good
for the stings of serpents; and the leaves, or else the juice, applied
as a liniment with wine, bring away the after-birth. The
leaves, also, in combination with salt and wine, are applied to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
scrofulous sores. The root is prescribed in wine for the stings
of serpents, and as a diuretic.</p>

<p>With a remarkable degree of inconsistency, the Greek writers,
while praising the buprestis<a id="FNanchor_2645_2645"></a><a href="#Footnote_2645_2645" class="fnanchor">2645</a> as an aliment, point out certain
antidotes<a id="FNanchor_2646_2646"></a><a href="#Footnote_2646_2646" class="fnanchor">2646</a> to it, as though it were a poison. The very name,
however, proves to a certainty that it is poisonous to cattle,
and it is generally admitted that, on tasting it, they burst<a id="FNanchor_2647_2647"></a><a href="#Footnote_2647_2647" class="fnanchor">2647</a>
asunder: we shall, therefore, say no more about it. Is there
any reason, in fact, why, when we are speaking of the materials
employed in making our grass crowns, we should describe
a poison? or really ought we to enlarge upon it only to
please the libidinous fancies of those who imagine that there is
not a more powerful aphrodisiac in existence than this, when
taken in drink?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_37"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 37.—THE ELAPHOBOSCON: NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The elaphoboscon<a id="FNanchor_2648_2648"></a><a href="#Footnote_2648_2648" class="fnanchor">2648</a> is a ferulaceous plant, articulated, and
about a finger in thickness. The seed of it is like that of dill,
hanging in umbels resembling those of hart-wort in appearance,
but not bitter. The leaves are very like those of olusatrum.<a id="FNanchor_2649_2649"></a><a href="#Footnote_2649_2649" class="fnanchor">2649</a>
This plant, too, is highly spoken of as an article of food; in
addition to which, it is preserved and kept as a diuretic<a id="FNanchor_2650_2650"></a><a href="#Footnote_2650_2650" class="fnanchor">2650</a> and
for the purpose of assuaging pains in the sides, curing ruptures
and convulsions, and dispelling flatulency and colic. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
is used, too, for the cure of wounds inflicted by serpents and all
kinds of animals that sting; so much so, indeed, that, as the
story goes, stags, by eating of it, fortify themselves against the
attacks of serpents. The root, too, applied topically, with the
addition of nitre, is a cure for fistula, but, when wanted for
this purpose, it must be dried first, so as to retain none of the
juice; though, on the other hand, this juice does not at all
impair its efficacy as an antidote to the poison of serpents.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_38"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 38.—THE SCANDIX: NINE REMEDIES. THE ANTHRISCUM:

<p>The scandix,<a id="FNanchor_2651_2651"></a><a href="#Footnote_2651_2651" class="fnanchor">2651</a> too, is reckoned by the Greeks in the number
of the wild vegetables, as we learn from Opion and Erasistratus.
Boiled, it arrests<a id="FNanchor_2652_2652"></a><a href="#Footnote_2652_2652" class="fnanchor">2652</a> looseness of the bowels; and the
seed of it, administered with vinegar, immediately stops
hiccup. It is employed topically for burns, and acts as a diuretic;
a decoction of it is good, too, for affections of the stomach,
liver, kidneys, and bladder. It is this plant that furnished
Aristophanes with his joke<a id="FNanchor_2653_2653"></a><a href="#Footnote_2653_2653" class="fnanchor">2653</a> against the poet Euripides, that
his mother used to sell not real vegetables, but only scandix.</p>

<p>The anthriscum<a id="FNanchor_2654_2654"></a><a href="#Footnote_2654_2654" class="fnanchor">2654</a> would be exactly the same plant as the
scandix, if its leaves were somewhat thinner and more odoriferous.
Its principal virtue is that it reinvigorates the body
when exhausted by sexual excesses, and acts as a stimulant
upon the enfeebled powers of old age. It arrests leucorrhœa
in females.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_39"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 39.—THE IASIONE: FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The iasione,<a id="FNanchor_2655_2655"></a><a href="#Footnote_2655_2655" class="fnanchor">2655</a> which is also looked upon as a wild vegetable,
is a creeping plant, full of a milky juice: it bears a white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
flower, the name given to which is “concilium.” The chief
recommendation of this plant, too, is that it acts as an aphrodisiac.
Eaten with the food, raw, in vinegar, it promotes the
secretion of the milk in nursing women. It is salutary also
for patients who are apprehensive of phthisis; and, applied to
the head of infants, it makes the hair grow, and renders the
scalp more firm.</p>

<p>The caucalis,<a id="FNanchor_2656_2656"></a><a href="#Footnote_2656_2656" class="fnanchor">2656</a> too, is an edible plant. It resembles fennel in
appearance, and has a short stem with a white flower;<a id="FNanchor_2657_2657"></a><a href="#Footnote_2657_2657" class="fnanchor">2657</a> it is
usually considered a good cordial.<a id="FNanchor_2658_2658"></a><a href="#Footnote_2658_2658" class="fnanchor">2658</a> The juice, too, of this plant
is taken as a potion, being particularly recommended as a stomachic,
a diuretic, an expellent of calculi and gravel, and for the
cure of irritations of the bladder. It has the effect, also, of
attenuating morbid secretions<a id="FNanchor_2659_2659"></a><a href="#Footnote_2659_2659" class="fnanchor">2659</a> of the spleen, liver, and kidneys.
The seed of it acts as an emmenagogue, and dispels the bilious
secretions after child-birth: it is prescribed also, for males, in
cases of seminal weakness. Chrysippus is of opinion that this
plant promotes conception; for which purpose it is taken by
women in wine, fasting. It is employed in the form of a liniment,
for wounds inflicted by marine animals of a venomous nature,
at least we find it so stated by Petrichus in his poem.<a id="FNanchor_2660_2660"></a><a href="#Footnote_2660_2660" class="fnanchor">2660</a></p>

<p>Among these plants there is reckoned also the sium:<a id="FNanchor_2661_2661"></a><a href="#Footnote_2661_2661" class="fnanchor">2661</a> it
grows in the water, has a leaf broader than that of parsley,
thicker, and of a more swarthy colour, bears a considerable
quantity of seed, and has the taste of nasturtium. It is an
active diuretic, is very good for the kidneys and spleen, and acts
as an emmenagogue, either eaten by itself as an aliment,<a id="FNanchor_2662_2662"></a><a href="#Footnote_2662_2662" class="fnanchor">2662</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>
taken in the form of a decoction; the seed of it is taken in
wine, in doses of two drachm&aelig;. It disperses calculi in the bladder,
and neutralizes the action of water which tends to their
formation. Used in the form of an injection, it is good for dysentery,
and applied topically, for the removal of freckles. It
is applied by females, at night, for the removal of spots on the
face, a result which it produces almost instantaneously. It
has the effect also of assuaging hernia, and is good for the scab
in horses.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_42"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 42.—THE SILLYBUM.</span></h3></div>

<p>The sillybum<a id="FNanchor_2663_2663"></a><a href="#Footnote_2663_2663" class="fnanchor">2663</a> resembles the white cham&aelig;leon, and is a
plant quite as prickly. In Cilicia, Syria, and Phœnicia, the
countries where it grows, it is not thought worth while to
boil it, the cooking of it being so extremely troublesome, it is
said. It is of no use whatever in medicine.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_43"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 43.—THE SCOLYMOS OR LIMONIA: FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The scolymos,<a id="FNanchor_2664_2664"></a><a href="#Footnote_2664_2664" class="fnanchor">2664</a> too, is used as an aliment<a id="FNanchor_2665_2665"></a><a href="#Footnote_2665_2665" class="fnanchor">2665</a> in the East, where
it has also the name of “limonia.”<a id="FNanchor_2666_2666"></a><a href="#Footnote_2666_2666" class="fnanchor">2666</a> This is a shrub-like plant,
which never exceeds a cubit in height, with tufted leaves and
a black root, but sweet. Eratosthenes speaks highly of it as
a diet used by the poor. It is said to possess diuretic properties
in a very high degree, and to heal lichens and leprous sores,
applied with vinegar. Taken in wine it acts as an aphrodisiac,
according to the testimony of Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_2667_2667"></a><a href="#Footnote_2667_2667" class="fnanchor">2667</a> and Alc&aelig;us; who have
stated in their writings, that while it is in blossom, the song
of the grasshopper is louder than at other times, women more
inflamed with desire, and men less inclined to amorous intercourse;
and that it is by a kind of foresight on the part of
Nature that this powerful stimulant is then in its greatest perfection.
The root, too, used without the pith, corrects the
noisome odour of the armpits, in doses of one ounce to two
hemin&aelig; of Falernian wine; the mixture being boiled down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
one third, and taken fasting after the bath, as also after meals, a
cyathus at a time. It is a remarkable thing, but Xenocrates
assures us that he has ascertained it experimentally, that these
bad odours are carried off by the urine.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_44"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 44.—THE SONCHOS; TWO VARIETIES: FIFTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The sonchos,<a id="FNanchor_2668_2668"></a><a href="#Footnote_2668_2668" class="fnanchor">2668</a> too, is edible—at least, it was this that, according
to Callimachus, Hecale<a id="FNanchor_2669_2669"></a><a href="#Footnote_2669_2669" class="fnanchor">2669</a> set before Theseus. There are two
kinds, the white<a id="FNanchor_2670_2670"></a><a href="#Footnote_2670_2670" class="fnanchor">2670</a> and the black:<a id="FNanchor_2671_2671"></a><a href="#Footnote_2671_2671" class="fnanchor">2671</a> they are, both of them,
similar to the lettuce, except that they are prickly, with a stem
a cubit in height, angular, and hollow within; when broken,
the stem gives out an abundance of milky juice. The white
kind, which derives its colour from the milk it contains, is good
for hardness of breathing, if eaten dressed with seasoning like
the lettuce. Erasistratus says that it carries off calculi by
the urine, and that, chewed, it is a corrective of bad breath.
The juice of it, taken warm in doses of three cyathi, with
white wine and oil, facilitates delivery, but the patient must
be careful to walk about immediately after drinking it: it
is also given in broth.</p>

<p>A decoction of the stalk renders the milk more abundant in
nursing women, and improves the complexion of the infants
suckled by them; it is also remarkably beneficial for females
when the milk coagulates. The juice of it is used as an injection
for the ears, and is taken warm in doses of one cyathus, for strangury,
as also for gnawing pains of the stomach, with cucumber
seed and pine nuts. It is employed topically for abscesses of
the rectum, and is taken in drink for the stings of serpents
and scorpions, the root also being applied to the wounds.
The root, boiled in oil, with the rind of a pomegranate, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
remedy for diseases of the ears—all these remedies, however,
be it remembered, are derived from the white kind.</p>

<p>As to the black sonchos, Cleemporus forbids it to be eaten,
as being productive of diseases, but at the same time he approves
of the use of the white. Agathocles, however, goes so
far as to assert that the juice of the black kind is an antidote
for poisoning by bulls’ blood; and, indeed, it is generally agreed
that the black sonchos has certain refreshing properties; for
which reason cataplasms of it may be advantageously applied
with polenta. Zeno recommends the root of the white kind
for strangury.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_45"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 45.—THE CONDRION OR CHONDRYLLA: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The condrion,<a id="FNanchor_2672_2672"></a><a href="#Footnote_2672_2672" class="fnanchor">2672</a> or chondrylla, has leaves, eaten away, as it
were, at the edges, and similar to those of endive, a
stalk less than a foot in length and full of a bitter juice,
and a root resembling that of the bean, and occasionally very
ramified. It produces, near the surface of the earth, a sort
of mastich,<a id="FNanchor_2673_2673"></a><a href="#Footnote_2673_2673" class="fnanchor">2673</a> in a tubercular form, the size of a bean; this
mastich, it is said, employed as a pessary, promotes the menstrual
discharge. This plant, pounded whole with the roots,
is divided into lozenges, which are employed for the stings of
serpents, and probably with good effect; for field mice, it is
said, when injured by those reptiles, are in the habit of eating
this plant. A decoction of it in wine arrests looseness of the
bowels, and makes a most excellent substitute for gum, as a
bandoline for the eye-lashes,<a id="FNanchor_2674_2674"></a><a href="#Footnote_2674_2674" class="fnanchor">2674</a> even when the hairs are most
stubborn. Dorotheus says, in his poems, that it is extremely
good for the stomach and the digestive organs. Some persons,
however, have been of opinion that it is unwholesome for females,
bad for the eyesight, and productive of impotence in
the male sex.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_46"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 46.—MUSHROOMS: PECULIARITIES OF THEIR GROWTH.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among those vegetable productions which are eaten with
risk, I shall, with good reason, include mushrooms;<a id="FNanchor_2675_2675"></a><a href="#Footnote_2675_2675" class="fnanchor">2675</a> a very
dainty food, it is true, but deservedly held in disesteem since
the notorious crime committed by Agrippina, who, through
their agency, poisoned her husband, the Emperor Claudius,
and at the same moment, in the person of his son Nero, inflicted
another poisonous curse upon the whole world, herself<a id="FNanchor_2676_2676"></a><a href="#Footnote_2676_2676" class="fnanchor">2676</a>
in particular.</p>

<p>Some of the poisonous mushrooms are easily known, being
of a rank, unwholesome look, light red without and livid
within, with the clefts<a id="FNanchor_2677_2677"></a><a href="#Footnote_2677_2677" class="fnanchor">2677</a> considerably enlarged, and a pale,
sickly margin to the head.<a id="FNanchor_2678_2678"></a><a href="#Footnote_2678_2678" class="fnanchor">2678</a> These characteristics, however,
are not presented by others of the poisonous kinds; but being
dry to all appearance and strongly resembling the genuine
ones, they present white spots upon the head, on the surface
of the outer coat. The earth, in fact, first produces the
uterus<a id="FNanchor_2679_2679"></a><a href="#Footnote_2679_2679" class="fnanchor">2679</a> or receptacle for the mushroom, and then the mushroom
within, like the yolk in the egg. Nor is this envelope
less conducive to the nutrition of the young mushroom [than
is the albumen of the egg to that of the chicken.] Bursting
forth from the envelope at the moment of its first appearance,
as it gradually increases it becomes transformed into a substantial
stalk; it is but very rarely, too, that we find two growing
from a single foot-stalk. The generative<a id="FNanchor_2680_2680"></a><a href="#Footnote_2680_2680" class="fnanchor">2680</a> principle of
the mushroom is in the slime and the fermenting juices of the
damp earth, or of the roots of most of the glandiferous trees.
It appears at first in the shape of a sort of viscous foam, and
then assumes a more substantial but membranous form, after
which, as already stated, the young mushroom appears.</p>

<p>In general, these plants are of a pernicious nature, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
use of them should be altogether rejected; for if by chance
they should happen to grow near a hob-nail,<a id="FNanchor_2681_2681"></a><a href="#Footnote_2681_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a> a piece of rusty
iron, or a bit of rotten cloth, they will immediately imbibe all
these foreign emanations and flavours, and transform them into
poison. Who, in fact, is able to distinguish them, except those
who dwell in the country, or the persons<a id="FNanchor_2682_2682"></a><a href="#Footnote_2682_2682" class="fnanchor">2682</a> that are in the habit
of gathering them? There are other circumstances, too, which
render them noxious; if they grow near the hole of a serpent,<a id="FNanchor_2683_2683"></a><a href="#Footnote_2683_2683" class="fnanchor">2683</a>
for instance, or if they should happen to have been breathed
upon by one when just beginning to open; being all the more
disposed to imbibe the venom from their natural affinity to
poisonous substances.</p>

<p>It will therefore be as well to be on our guard during the
season at which the serpents have not as yet retired to their
holes for the winter. The best sign to know this by is a multitude
of herbs, of trees, and of shrubs, which remain green
from the time that these reptiles leave their holes till their return;
indeed, the ash alone will be quite sufficient for the
purpose, the leaves of it never coming out after the serpents
have made their appearance, or beginning to fall before they
have retired to their holes. The entire existence of the mushroom,
from its birth to its death, is never more than seven
days.<a id="FNanchor_2684_2684"></a><a href="#Footnote_2684_2684" class="fnanchor">2684</a></p>

<p>Fungi are of a more humid nature than the last, and are divided
into numerous kinds, all of which are derived solely from
the pituitous humours<a id="FNanchor_2685_2685"></a><a href="#Footnote_2685_2685" class="fnanchor">2685</a> of trees. The safest are those, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>
flesh of which is red,<a id="FNanchor_2686_2686"></a><a href="#Footnote_2686_2686" class="fnanchor">2686</a> the colour being more pronounced than
that of the mushroom. The next best are the white<a id="FNanchor_2687_2687"></a><a href="#Footnote_2687_2687" class="fnanchor">2687</a> ones, the
stems of which have a head very similar to the apex<a id="FNanchor_2688_2688"></a><a href="#Footnote_2688_2688" class="fnanchor">2688</a> worn by
the Flamens; and a third kind are the suilli,<a id="FNanchor_2689_2689"></a><a href="#Footnote_2689_2689" class="fnanchor">2689</a> very conveniently
adapted for poisoning. Indeed, it is but very recently

doubtful<a id="FNanchor_2691_2691"></a><a href="#Footnote_2691_2691" class="fnanchor">2691</a> a character as this? Some persons have classified
these fungi according to the trees to which they are indebted
for their formation, the fig, for instance, the fennel-giant, and
the gummiferous trees; those belonging to the beech, the robur,

who is there to give us a guarantee when they come to market,

<p>All the poisonous fungi are of a livid colour; and the degree
of similarity borne by the sap of the tree itself to that of the
fig will afford an additional indication whether they are venomous
or not. We have already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2693_2693"></a><a href="#Footnote_2693_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a> various remedies
for the poison of fungi, and shall have occasion to make mention
of others; but in the mean time, it will be as well to observe
that they themselves also have some medicinal<a id="FNanchor_2694_2694"></a><a href="#Footnote_2694_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a> uses. Glaucias<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
is of opinion that mushrooms are good for the stomach. The
suilli are dried and strung upon a rush, as we see done with those
brought from Bithynia. They are employed as a remedy for
the fluxes known as “rheumatismi,”<a id="FNanchor_2695_2695"></a><a href="#Footnote_2695_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a> and for excrescences of
the fundament, which they diminish and gradually consume.
They are used, also, for freckles and spots on women’s faces.
A wash, too, is made of them, as is done with lead,<a id="FNanchor_2696_2696"></a><a href="#Footnote_2696_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a> for maladies
of the eyes. Steeped in water, they are applied topically
to foul ulcers, eruptions of the head, and bites inflicted by
dogs.</p>

<p>I would here also give some general directions for the cooking
of mushrooms, as this is the only article of food that the
voluptuaries of the present day are in the habit of dressing
with their own hands, and so feeding upon it in anticipation,
being provided with amber-handled<a id="FNanchor_2697_2697"></a><a href="#Footnote_2697_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a> knives and silver plates
and dishes for the purpose. Those fungi may be looked upon
as bad which become hard in cooking; while those, on the other
hand, are comparatively innoxious, which admit of being thoroughly
boiled, with the addition of some nitre. They will
be all the safer if they are boiled with some meat or the stalks
of pears: it is a very good plan, too, to eat pears directly after
them. Vinegar, too, being of a nature diametrically opposed
to them, neutralizes<a id="FNanchor_2698_2698"></a><a href="#Footnote_2698_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a> their dangerous qualities.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_48"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 48.—SILPHIUM: SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>All these productions owe their origin to rain,<a id="FNanchor_2699_2699"></a><a href="#Footnote_2699_2699" class="fnanchor">2699</a> and by rain
is silphium produced. It originally came from Cyren&aelig;, as
already<a id="FNanchor_2700_2700"></a><a href="#Footnote_2700_2700" class="fnanchor">2700</a> stated: at the present day, it is mostly imported from
Syria, the produce of which country, though better than that
of Media, is inferior to the Parthian kind. As already observed,<a id="FNanchor_2701_2701"></a><a href="#Footnote_2701_2701" class="fnanchor">2701</a>
the silphium of Cyren&aelig; no longer exists. It is of
considerable use in medicine, the leaves of it being employed
to purge the uterus, and as an expellent of the dead fœtus;
for which purposes a decoction of them is made in white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>
aromatic wine, and taken in doses of one acetabulum, immediately
after the bath. The root of it is good for irritations of
the trachea, and is employed topically for extravasated blood;
but, used as an aliment, it is difficult of digestion, being productive
of flatulency and eructations: it is injurious, also, to
the urinary secretions. Combined with wine and oil, it is extremely
good for bruises, and, with wax, for the cure of scrofulous
sores. Repeated fumigations with the root cause excrescences
of the anus to subside.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_49"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 49.—LASER: THIRTY-NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Laser, a juice which distils from silphium, as we have already<a id="FNanchor_2702_2702"></a><a href="#Footnote_2702_2702" class="fnanchor">2702</a>
stated, and reckoned among the most precious gifts
presented to us by Nature, is made use of in numerous medicinal
preparations. Employed by itself, it warms and revives
persons benumbed with cold, and, taken in drink, it alleviates
affections of the sinews. It is given to females in wine, and
is used with soft wool as a pessary to promote the menstrual
discharge. Mixed with wax, it extracts corns on the feet,
after they have been first loosened with the knife: a piece of
it, the size of a chick-pea, melted in water, acts as a diuretic.
Andreas assures us that, taken in considerable doses even, it is
never productive of flatulency, and that it greatly promotes
the digestion, both in aged people and females; he says, too,
that it is better used in winter than in summer, and that even
then, it is best suited for those whose beverage is water: but
due care must be taken that there is no internal ulceration.
Taken with the food, it is very refreshing for patients just recovering
from an illness; indeed, if it is used at the proper
time, it has all the virtues of a desiccatory,<a id="FNanchor_2703_2703"></a><a href="#Footnote_2703_2703" class="fnanchor">2703</a> though it is more
wholesome for persons who are in the habit of using it than
for those who do not ordinarily employ it.</p>

<p>As to external maladies, the undoubted virtues of this medicament
are universally acknowledged: taken in drink, it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>
the effect, also, of neutralizing the venom of serpents and of
poisoned weapons, and, applied with water, it is in general use
for the cure of wounds. In combination with oil, it is only
used as a liniment for the stings of scorpions, and with barley-meal
or dried figs, for the cure of ulcers that have not come to
a head. It is applied topically, also, to carbuncles, with rue
or honey, or else by itself, with some viscous substance to
make it adhere; for the bites of dogs, also, it is similarly employed.
A decoction of it in vinegar, with pomegranate rind,
is used for excrescences<a id="FNanchor_2704_2704"></a><a href="#Footnote_2704_2704" class="fnanchor">2704</a> of the fundament, and, mixed with
nitre, for the corns commonly known as “morticini.”<a id="FNanchor_2705_2705"></a><a href="#Footnote_2705_2705" class="fnanchor">2705</a> In
cases of alopecy which have been first treated with nitre, it
makes the hair grow again, applied with wine and saffron, or
else pepper or mouse-dung and vinegar. For chilblains, fomentations
are made of it with wine, or liniments with oil;
as also for callosities and indurations. For corns on the feet,
if pared first, it is particularly useful, as also as a preservative
against the effects of bad water, and of unhealthy climates or
weather. It is prescribed for cough, too, affections of the
uvula, jaundice of long standing, dropsy, and hoarseness, having
the effect of instantly clearing the throat and restoring the
voice. Diluted in oxycrate, and applied with a sponge, it
assuages the pains in gout.</p>

<p>It is given also in broth<a id="FNanchor_2706_2706"></a><a href="#Footnote_2706_2706" class="fnanchor">2706</a> to patients suffering from pleurisy,
when about to take wine; and it is prescribed for convulsions
and opisthotony, in pills about as large as a chick-pea, coated
with wax. For quinsy, it is used as a gargle, and to patients
troubled with asthma or inveterate cough, it is given with
leeks in vinegar; it is prescribed, also, with vinegar, after
drinking butter-milk.<a id="FNanchor_2707_2707"></a><a href="#Footnote_2707_2707" class="fnanchor">2707</a> It is recommended with wine for consumptive
affections of the viscera and epilepsy, and with hydromel
for paralysis of the tongue; with a decoction of honey,
it forms a liniment for sciatica and lumbago.</p>

<p>For my own part, I should not recommend,<a id="FNanchor_2708_2708"></a><a href="#Footnote_2708_2708" class="fnanchor">2708</a> what some
authors advise, to insert a pill of laser, covered with wax, in
a hollow tooth, for tooth-ache; being warned to the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>
by a remarkable case of a man, who, after doing so, threw
himself headlong from the top of a house. Besides, it is a
well-known fact, that if it is rubbed on the muzzle of a bull, it
irritates him to an extraordinary degree; and that if it is mixed
with wine, it will cause serpents to burst—those reptiles being
extremely fond of wine. In addition to this, I should not
advise any one to rub the gums with Attic honey, although
that practice is recommended by some.</p>

<p>It would be an endless task to enumerate all the uses to
which laser is put, in combination with other substances; and
the more so, as it is only our object to treat of simple remedies,
it being these in which Nature displays her resources.
In the compound remedies, too, we often find our judgment
deceived, and quite at fault, from our comparative inattention
to the sympathy or antipathy which naturally exists between
the ingredients employed—on this subject, however, we shall
have to enlarge on a future occasion.<a id="FNanchor_2709_2709"></a><a href="#Footnote_2709_2709" class="fnanchor">2709</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_50"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 50. (24.)—PROPOLIS: FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Honey would be held in no less esteem than laser, were it
not for the fact that nearly every country produces it.<a id="FNanchor_2710_2710"></a><a href="#Footnote_2710_2710" class="fnanchor">2710</a> Laser
is the production of Nature herself; but, for the formation of
honey, she has created an insect, as already described.<a id="FNanchor_2711_2711"></a><a href="#Footnote_2711_2711" class="fnanchor">2711</a>
The uses to which honey is put are quite innumerable, if we
only consider the vast number of compositions in which it
forms an ingredient. First of all, there is the propolis,<a id="FNanchor_2712_2712"></a><a href="#Footnote_2712_2712" class="fnanchor">2712</a>
which we find in the hives, as already<a id="FNanchor_2713_2713"></a><a href="#Footnote_2713_2713" class="fnanchor">2713</a> mentioned. This
substance has the property of extracting stings and all foreign
bodies from the flesh, dispersing tumours, ripening indurations,
allaying pains of the sinews, and cicatrizing ulcers of the most
obstinate nature.</p>

<p>As to honey itself, it is of so peculiar a nature, that it prevents
putrefaction<a id="FNanchor_2714_2714"></a><a href="#Footnote_2714_2714" class="fnanchor">2714</a> from supervening, by reason of its sweetness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>
solely, and not any inherent acridity, its natural properties
being altogether different from those of salt. It is
employed with the greatest success for affections<a id="FNanchor_2715_2715"></a><a href="#Footnote_2715_2715" class="fnanchor">2715</a> of the throat
and tonsils, for quinsy and all ailments of the mouth, as also
in fever, when the tongue is parched. Decoctions of it are
used also for peripneumony and pleurisy, for wounds inflicted
by serpents, and for the poison of fungi. For paralysis, it is
prescribed in honied wine, though that liquor also has its own
peculiar virtues. Honey is used with rose-oil, as an injection
for the ears; it has the effect also of exterminating nits and
foul vermin of the head. It is the best plan always to skim
it before using it.</p>

<p>Still, however, honey has a tendency to inflate<a id="FNanchor_2716_2716"></a><a href="#Footnote_2716_2716" class="fnanchor">2716</a> the stomach;
it increases the bilious secretions also, produces qualmishness,
and, according to some, if employed by itself, is injurious<a id="FNanchor_2717_2717"></a><a href="#Footnote_2717_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a> to
the sight: though, on the other hand, there are persons who
recommend ulcerations at the corners of the eyes to be touched
with honey.</p>

<p>As to the elementary principles of honey, the different
varieties of it, the countries where it is found, and its characteristic
features, we have enlarged upon them on previous
occasions: first,<a id="FNanchor_2718_2718"></a><a href="#Footnote_2718_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a> when treating of the nature of bees, and
secondly, when speaking<a id="FNanchor_2719_2719"></a><a href="#Footnote_2719_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a> of that of flowers; the plan of this
work compelling us to separate subjects which ought properly
to be united, if we would arrive at a thorough knowledge of
the operations of Nature.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_51"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 51.—THE VARIOUS INFLUENCES OF DIFFERENT ALIMENTS
UPON THE DISPOSITION.</span></h3></div>

<p>While speaking of the uses of honey, we ought also to treat
of the properties of hydromel.<a id="FNanchor_2720_2720"></a><a href="#Footnote_2720_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a> There are two kinds of hydromel,
one of which is prepared at the moment, and taken
while fresh,<a id="FNanchor_2721_2721"></a><a href="#Footnote_2721_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a> the other being kept to ripen. The first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>
which is made of skimmed honey, is an extremely wholesome
beverage for invalids who take nothing but a light diet,
such as strained alica for instance: it reinvigorates the body,
is soothing to the mouth and stomach, and by its refreshing
properties allays feverish heats. I find it stated,<a id="FNanchor_2722_2722"></a><a href="#Footnote_2722_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a> too, by
some authors, that to relax the bowels it should be taken cold,
and that it is particularly well-suited for persons of a chilly
temperament, or of a weak and pusillanimous<a id="FNanchor_2723_2723"></a><a href="#Footnote_2723_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a> constitution,
such as the Greeks, for instance, call “micropsychi.”</p>

<p>For there is a theory,<a id="FNanchor_2724_2724"></a><a href="#Footnote_2724_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a> remarkable for its extreme ingenuity,
first established by Plato, according to which the primary atoms
of bodies, as they happen to be smooth or rough, angular or
round, are more or less adapted to the various temperaments
of individuals: and hence it is, that the same substances are
not universally sweet or bitter to all. So, when affected with
lassitude or thirst, we are more prone to anger than at other
times.<a id="FNanchor_2725_2725"></a><a href="#Footnote_2725_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a> These asperities, however, of the disposition, or rather
I should say of the mind,<a id="FNanchor_2726_2726"></a><a href="#Footnote_2726_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a> are capable of being modified by
the sweeter beverages; as they tend to lubricate the passages
for the respiration, and to mollify the channels, the work of
inhalation and exhalation being thereby unimpeded by any
rigidities. Every person must be sensible of this experimentally,
in his own case: there is no one in whom anger, affliction,
sadness, and all the emotions of the mind may not, in
some degree, be modified by diet. It will therefore be worth
our while to observe what aliments they are which exercise a
physical effect, not only upon the body, but the disposition
as well.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_52"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 52.—HYDROMEL: EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Hydromel is recommended, too, as very good for a cough:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
taken warm, it promotes vomiting. With the addition of oil
it counteracts the poison of white lead;<a id="FNanchor_2727_2727"></a><a href="#Footnote_2727_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a> of henbane, also,
and of the halicacabum, as already stated,<a id="FNanchor_2728_2728"></a><a href="#Footnote_2728_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a> if taken in milk,
asses’ milk in particular. It is used as an injection for diseases
of the ears, and in cases of fistula of the generative
organs. With crumb of bread it is applied as a poultice to
the uterus, as also to tumours suddenly formed, sprains, and
all affections which require soothing applications. The more
recent writers have condemned the use of fermented hydromel,
as being not so harmless as water, and less strengthening
than wine. After it has been kept a considerable time, it
becomes transformed into a wine,<a id="FNanchor_2729_2729"></a><a href="#Footnote_2729_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a> which, it is universally
agreed, is extremely prejudicial to the stomach, and injurious
to the nerves.<a id="FNanchor_2730_2730"></a><a href="#Footnote_2730_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_53"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 53.—HONIED WINE: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>As to honied<a id="FNanchor_2731_2731"></a><a href="#Footnote_2731_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a> wine, that is always the best which has been
made with old wine: honey, too, incorporates with it very
readily, which is never the case with sweet<a id="FNanchor_2732_2732"></a><a href="#Footnote_2732_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a> wine. When
made with astringent wine, it does not clog the stomach, nor
has it that effect when the honey has been boiled: in this last
case, too, it causes less flatulency, an inconvenience generally
incidental to this beverage. It acts as a stimulant also upon
a failing appetite; taken cold it relaxes the bowels, but used
warm it acts astringently, in most cases, at least. It has a
tendency also to make flesh. Many persons have attained an
extreme old age, by taking bread soaked in honied wine, and
no other diet—the famous instance of Pollio Romilius, for example.
This man was more than one hundred years old when
the late Emperor Augustus, who was then his host,<a id="FNanchor_2733_2733"></a><a href="#Footnote_2733_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a> asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>
him by what means in particular he had retained such remarkable
vigour of mind and body.—“Honied wine within, oil
without,”<a id="FNanchor_2734_2734"></a><a href="#Footnote_2734_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a> was his answer. According to Varro, the jaundice
has the name of “royal disease”<a id="FNanchor_2735_2735"></a><a href="#Footnote_2735_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a> given to it, because its
cure is effected with honied wine.<a id="FNanchor_2736_2736"></a><a href="#Footnote_2736_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_54"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 54.—MELITITES: THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have already described how melitites<a id="FNanchor_2737_2737"></a><a href="#Footnote_2737_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a> is prepared, of
must and honey, when speaking on the subject of wines. It
is, I think, some ages, however, since this kind of beverage
was made, so extremely productive as it was found to be of
flatulency. It used, however, to be given in fever, to relieve
inveterate costiveness of the bowels, as also for gout and affections
of the sinews. It was prescribed also for females who
were not in the habit of taking wine.</p>

previously made mention<a id="FNanchor_2738_2738"></a><a href="#Footnote_2738_2738" class="fnanchor">2738</a> on the appropriate occasions.
Every kind of wax is emollient and warming, and tends to
the formation of new flesh; fresh wax is, however, the best.
It is given in broth to persons troubled with dysentery, and
the combs themselves are sometimes used in a pottage made of
parched alica. Wax counteracts the bad effects<a id="FNanchor_2739_2739"></a><a href="#Footnote_2739_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a> of milk;
and ten pills of wax, the size of a grain of millet, will prevent
milk from coagulating in the stomach. For swellings in
the groin, it is found beneficial to apply a plaster of white wax
to the pubes.</p>

<p>As to the different uses to which wax is applied, in combination
with other substances in medicine, we could no more
make an enumeration of them than we could of all the other
ingredients which form part of our medicinal compositions.
These preparations, as we have already<a id="FNanchor_2740_2740"></a><a href="#Footnote_2740_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> observed, are the results
of human invention. Cerates, poultices,<a id="FNanchor_2741_2741"></a><a href="#Footnote_2741_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a> plasters, eye-salves,
antidotes,—none of these have been formed by Nature,
that parent and divine framer of the universe; they are merely
the inventions of the laboratory, or rather, to say the truth,
of human avarice.<a id="FNanchor_2742_2742"></a><a href="#Footnote_2742_2742" class="fnanchor">2742</a> The works of Nature are brought into
existence complete and perfect in every respect, her ingredients
being but few in number, selected as they are from a
due appreciation of cause and effect, and not from mere guesswork;
thus, for instance, if a dry substance is wanted to assume
a liquefied form, a liquid, of course, must be employed as
a vehicle, while liquids, on the other hand, must be united with
a dry substance to render them consistent. But as for man,
when he pretends, with balance in<a id="FNanchor_2743_2743"></a><a href="#Footnote_2743_2743" class="fnanchor">2743</a> hand, to unite and combine
the various elementary substances, he employs himself
not merely upon guesswork, but proves himself guilty of downright
impudence.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to touch upon the medicaments afforded
by the drugs of India, or Arabia and other foreign
climates: I have no liking for drugs that come from so great a
distance;<a id="FNanchor_2744_2744"></a><a href="#Footnote_2744_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a> they are not produced for us, no, nor yet for the
natives of those countries, or else they would not be so ready
to sell them to us. Let people buy them if they please, as
ingredients in perfumes, unguents, and other appliances of
luxury; let them buy them as adjuncts to their superstitions
even, if incense and costus we must have to propitiate the
gods; but as to health, we can enjoy that blessing without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>
their assistance, as we can easily prove—the greater reason
then has luxury to blush at its excesses.</p>

<p>Having now described the remedies derived from flowers, both
those which enter into the composition of garlands, and the
ordinary garden ones, as well as from the vegetable productions,
how could we possibly omit those which are derived from the
cereals?</p>

<p>(25.) It will be only proper then, to make some mention of
these as well. In the first place, however, let us remark that
it is a fact universally acknowledged, that it is the most intelligent
of the animated beings that derive their subsistence
from grain. The grain of siligo<a id="FNanchor_2745_2745"></a><a href="#Footnote_2745_2745" class="fnanchor">2745</a> highly roasted and pounded
in Aminean<a id="FNanchor_2746_2746"></a><a href="#Footnote_2746_2746" class="fnanchor">2746</a> wine, applied to the eyes, heals defluxions of
those organs;<a id="FNanchor_2747_2747"></a><a href="#Footnote_2747_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a> and the grain of wheat, parched on a plate of
iron, is an instantaneous remedy for frost-bite in various parts

<p>Sextus Pomponius, who had a son pr&aelig;tor, and who was
himself the first citizen of Nearer Spain, was on one occasion
attacked with gout, while superintending the winnowing in
his granaries; upon which, he immediately thrust his legs,
to above the knees, in a heap of wheat. He found himself relieved,
the swelling in the legs subsided in a most surprising
degree, and from that time he always employed this remedy:
indeed, the action of grain in masses is so extremely powerful
as to cause the entire evaporation of the liquor in a cask. Men of
experience in these matters recommend warm chaff of wheat
or barley, as an application for hernia, and fomentations with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
the water in which it has been boiled. In the grain
known<a id="FNanchor_2751_2751"></a><a href="#Footnote_2751_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a> as spelt, there is a small worm found, similar in appearance
to the teredo:<a id="FNanchor_2752_2752"></a><a href="#Footnote_2752_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a> if this is put with wax into the hollow
of carious teeth, they will come out, it is said, or, indeed,
if the teeth are only rubbed with it. Another name given
to olyra, as already<a id="FNanchor_2753_2753"></a><a href="#Footnote_2753_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a> mentioned, is “arinca:” with a decoction
of it a medicament is made, known in Egypt as “athera,”
and extremely good for infants. For adult persons it is employed
in the form of a liniment.</p>

<p>Barley<a id="FNanchor_2754_2754"></a><a href="#Footnote_2754_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a>-meal, raw or boiled, disperses, softens, or ripens gatherings
and inflammatory tumours; and for other purposes
a decoction of it is made in hydromel, or with dried figs. If
required for pains in the liver, it must be boiled with oxycrate
in wine. When it is a matter of doubt whether an abscess
should be made to suppurate or be dispersed, it is a better
plan to boil the meal in vinegar, or lees of vinegar, or else
with a decoction of quinces or pears. For the bite of the
millepede,<a id="FNanchor_2755_2755"></a><a href="#Footnote_2755_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a> it is employed with honey, and for the stings of
serpents, and to prevent suppurations, with vinegar. To promote
suppuration, it should be used with oxycrate, with the
addition of Gallic resin. For gatherings, also, that have come
to a head, and ulcers of long standing, it must be employed
in combination with resin, and for indurations, with pigeons’
dung, dried figs, or ashes. For inflammation of the tendons,
or of the intestines and sides, or for pains in the male organs and
denudations of the bones, it is used with poppies, or melilote;
and for scrofulous sores, it is used with pitch and oil, mixed
with the urine of a youth who has not reached the years of puberty.
It is employed also with fenugreek for tumours of
the thoracic organs, and in fevers, with honey, or stale grease.</p>

<p>For suppurations, however, wheat-meal is much more soothing;<a id="FNanchor_2756_2756"></a><a href="#Footnote_2756_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>
it is applied topically also for affections of the sinews,
mixed with the juice of henbane, and for the cure of freckles,
with vinegar and honey. The meal of zea,<a id="FNanchor_2757_2757"></a><a href="#Footnote_2757_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a> from which, as
already<a id="FNanchor_2758_2758"></a><a href="#Footnote_2758_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a> stated, an alica is made, appears to be more efficacious
than that of barley even; but that of the three month<a id="FNanchor_2759_2759"></a><a href="#Footnote_2759_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a> kind
is the most emollient. It is applied warm, in red wine, to
the stings of scorpions, as also for affections of the trachea,
and spitting of blood: for coughs, it is employed in combination
with goat suet or butter.</p>

<p>The meal of fenugreek,<a id="FNanchor_2760_2760"></a><a href="#Footnote_2760_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a> however, is the most soothing of
them all: boiled with wine and nitre, it heals running ulcers,
eruptions on the body, and diseases of the feet and mamill&aelig;.
The meal of &aelig;ra<a id="FNanchor_2761_2761"></a><a href="#Footnote_2761_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a> is more detergent than the other kinds, for
inveterate ulcers and gangrenes: in combination with radishes,
salt, and vinegar, it heals lichens, and with virgin sulphur,
leprosy: for head-ache, it is applied to the forehead
with goose-grease. Boiled in wine, with pigeons’ dung and
linseed, it ripens inflamed tumours and scrofulous sores.</p>

not think that it was yet in use in the days of Pompeius
Magnus, a circumstance which will explain why hardly any
mention has been made of it in the works of the school of
Asclepiades. That it is a most excellent preparation no one
can have a doubt, whether it is used strained in hydromel, or
whether it is boiled and taken in the form of broth or puls. To
arrest flux of the bowels, it is first parched and then boiled
with honeycomb, as already mentioned:<a id="FNanchor_2769_2769"></a><a href="#Footnote_2769_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a> but it is more particularly
useful when there is a tendency to phthisis after a
long illness, the proper proportions being three cyathi of it to
one sextarius of water. This mixture is boiled till all the
water has gone off by evaporation, after which one sextarius
of sheep’ or goats’ milk is added: it is then taken by the
patient daily, and after a time some honey is added. By this
kind of nutriment a deep decline may be cured.</p>

It has a similar effect even while in the blade; and in that

eyes. As an aliment it is injurious to the stomach, and imparts
a bad odour to the breath. It is an antidote to the bite

“cacoethes.”<a id="FNanchor_2774_2774"></a><a href="#Footnote_2774_2774" class="fnanchor">2774</a> The oil made from it, as already<a id="FNanchor_2775_2775"></a><a href="#Footnote_2775_2775" class="fnanchor">2775</a> mentioned, is

erysipelas: it disperses inflamed swellings also. Besides this,
there is another<a id="FNanchor_2778_2778"></a><a href="#Footnote_2778_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a> sesamo&iuml;des, which grows at Anticyra, and,

pulp of it is divided into lozenges, which are used in injections
for ulcerations of the intestines and the uterus. The
ashes of barley are applied to burns, to bones denuded of the
flesh, to purulent eruptions, and to the bite of the shrew-mouse:
sprinkled with salt and honey they impart whiteness
to the teeth, and sweetness to the breath. It is alleged that
persons who are in the habit of eating barley-bread are never
troubled with gout in the feet: they say, too, that if a person
takes nine grains of barley, and traces three times round a
boil, with each of them in the left hand, and then throws
them all into the fire, he will experience an immediate cure.
There is another plant, too, known as “phœnice” by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Greeks, and as “mouse-barley”<a id="FNanchor_2781_2781"></a><a href="#Footnote_2781_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a> by us: pounded and taken

<p>To ptisan,<a id="FNanchor_2782_2782"></a><a href="#Footnote_2782_2782" class="fnanchor">2782</a> which is a preparation of barley, Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_2783_2783"></a><a href="#Footnote_2783_2783" class="fnanchor">2783</a>
has devoted a whole treatise; praises, however, which at the
present day are all transferred to “alica,” being, as it is, a
much more wholesome preparation. Hippocrates, however,
recommends it as a pottage, for the comparative ease with
which, from its lubricous nature, it is swallowed; as also, because
it allays thirst, never swells in the stomach, passes easily
through the intestines, and is the only food that admits of
being given twice a-day in fever, at least to patients who are
in the habit of taking two meals—so opposed is his method
to that of those physicians who are for famishing their patients.
He forbids it to be given, however, without being
first strained; for no part, he says, of the ptisan, except the
water,<a id="FNanchor_2784_2784"></a><a href="#Footnote_2784_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a> should be used. He says, too, that it must never be
taken while the feet are cold, and, indeed, that no drink of
any kind should be taken then. With wheat a more viscous
kind of ptisan is made, which is found to be still more efficacious
for ulcerations of the trachea.</p>

<p>Bread,<a id="FNanchor_2787_2787"></a><a href="#Footnote_2787_2787" class="fnanchor">2787</a> too, which forms our ordinary nutriment, possesses
medicinal properties, almost without number. Applied with
water and oil, or else rose-oil, it softens abscesses; and, with
hydromel, it is remarkably soothing for indurations. It is prescribed
with wine to produce delitescence, or when a defluxion
requires to be checked; or, if additional activity is required,
with vinegar. It is employed also for the morbid defluxions of
rheum, known to the Greeks as “rheumatismi,” and for
bruises and sprains. For all these purposes, however, bread
made with leaven, and known as “autopyrus,”<a id="FNanchor_2788_2788"></a><a href="#Footnote_2788_2788" class="fnanchor">2788</a> is the best.</p>

<p>It is applied also to whitlows, in vinegar, and to callosities of

again, arrests looseness of the bowels. For persons who wish to
improve the voice, dry bread is very good, taken fasting; it
is useful also as a preservative against catarrhs. The bread
called “sitanius,” and which is made of three-month<a id="FNanchor_2790_2790"></a><a href="#Footnote_2790_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a> wheat,
applied with honey, is a very efficient cure for contusions of
the face and scaly eruptions. White bread, steeped in hot or
cold water, furnishes a very light and wholesome aliment for
patients. Soaked in wine, it is applied as a poultice for
swellings of the eyes, and used in a similar manner, or with
the addition of dried myrtle, it is good for pustules on the
head. Persons troubled with palsy are recommended to take
bread soaked in water, fasting, immediately after the bath.
Burnt bread modifies the close smell of bedrooms, and, used

of the bowels. Bruised, and boiled with garlic, they are
taken with the daily food for inveterate coughs, and for suppurations
of the chest. Chewed by a person fasting, they are
applied topically to ripen boils, or to disperse them; and,
boiled in wine, they are employed for swellings of the testes
and diseases of the genitals. Bean-meal, boiled in vinegar,
ripens tumours and breaks them, and heals contusions and
burns. M. Varro assures us that beans are very good for the
voice. The ashes of bean stalks and shells, with stale hogs’-lard,
are good for sciatica and inveterate pains of the sinews.
The husks, too, boiled down, by themselves, to one-third,

<p>Those lentils<a id="FNanchor_2793_2793"></a><a href="#Footnote_2793_2793" class="fnanchor">2793</a> are the best which boil the most easily, and

particularly if they are thoroughly boiled in rain-water: if,
on the other hand, they are lightly boiled, they are laxative.<a id="FNanchor_2795_2795"></a><a href="#Footnote_2795_2795" class="fnanchor">2795</a>
They break purulent ulcers, and they cleanse and cicatrize
ulcerations of the mouth. Applied topically, they allay all
kinds of abscesses, when ulcerated and chapped more particularly;
with melilote or quinces they are applied to defluxions
of the eyes, and with polenta they are employed topically for
suppurations. A decoction of them is used for ulcerations of
the mouth and genitals, and, with rose-oil or quinces, for
diseases of the fundament. For affections which demand a
more active remedy, they are used with pomegranate rind,
and the addition of a little honey; to prevent the composition
from drying too quickly, beet leaves are added. They are applied
topically, also, to scrofulous sores, and to tumours, whether
ripe or only coming to a head, being thoroughly boiled first
in vinegar. Mixed with hydromel they are employed for the
cure of chaps, and with pomegranate rind for gangrenes.
With polenta they are used for gout, for diseases of the
uterus and kidneys, for chilblains, and for ulcerations which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>
cicatrize with difficulty. For a disordered stomach, thirty
grains should be eaten.</p>

<p>For cholera,<a id="FNanchor_2796_2796"></a><a href="#Footnote_2796_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a> however, and dysentery, it is the best plan to
boil the lentils in three waters, in which case they should
always be parched first, and then pounded as fine as possible,
either by themselves, or else with quinces, pears, myrtle, wild
endive, black beet, or plantago. Lentils are bad for the
lungs, head-ache, all nervous affections, and bile, and are very
apt to cause restlessness at night. They are useful, however,
for pustules, erysipelas, and affections of the mamill&aelig;, boiled
in sea-water; and, applied with vinegar, they disperse indurations
and scrofulous sores. As a stomachic, they are mixed,
like polenta, with the drink given to patients. Parboiled in
water, and then pounded and bolted through a sieve to disengage
the bran, they are good for burns, care being taken to
add a little honey as they heal: they are boiled, also, with
oxycrate for diseases of the throat.<a id="FNanchor_2797_2797"></a><a href="#Footnote_2797_2797" class="fnanchor">2797</a></p>

<p>There is a marsh-lentil<a id="FNanchor_2798_2798"></a><a href="#Footnote_2798_2798" class="fnanchor">2798</a> also, which grows spontaneously
in stagnant waters. It is of a cooling nature, for which reason
it is employed topically for abscesses, and for gout in particular,
either by itself or with polenta. Its glutinous properties

of a powerful smell, the other one being milder. It<a id="FNanchor_2801_2801"></a><a href="#Footnote_2801_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a> has leaves
the shape of a quince, but white and smaller: they are generally
boiled with the branches. This plant acts as an emmenagogue
and a diuretic: and it affords a remedy for wounds
inflicted by the sting-ray,<a id="FNanchor_2802_2802"></a><a href="#Footnote_2802_2802" class="fnanchor">2802</a> having the property of benumbing
the part affected. It is taken in drink with wormwood for
dysentery: employed with wine it accelerates the catamenia
when retarded, a decoction of it having the effect of arresting
them when in excess: the plant, applied by itself, stanches
the blood of wounds. It is a cure, too, for the stings of serpents,
and a decoction of it in wine allays prurigo of the
testes.</p>

<p>Our herbalists of the present day take for the “elelisphacos”
of the Greeks the “salvia”<a id="FNanchor_2803_2803"></a><a href="#Footnote_2803_2803" class="fnanchor">2803</a> of the Latins, a plant similar in
appearance to mint, white and aromatic. Applied externally,
it expels the dead fœtus, as also worms which breed in ulcers
and in the ears.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_72"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 72.—THE CHICKPEA AND THE CHICHELING VETCH:
TWENTY-THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is a wild chickpea also, which resembles in its leaf the
cultivated kind,<a id="FNanchor_2804_2804"></a><a href="#Footnote_2804_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a> and has a powerful smell. Taken in considerable
quantities, it relaxes the bowels, and produces griping
pains and flatulency; parched, however, it is looked upon as
more wholesome. The chicheling vetch,<a id="FNanchor_2805_2805"></a><a href="#Footnote_2805_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a> again, acts more beneficially
upon the bowels. The meal of both kinds heals running
sores of the head—that of the wild sort being the more efficacious
of the two—as also epilepsy, swellings of the liver, and
stings inflicted by serpents. It acts as an emmenagogue and
a diuretic, used in the grain more particularly, and it is a cure
for lichens, inflammations of the testes, jaundice, and dropsy.
All these kinds, however, exercise an injurious effect upon
ulcerations of the bladder and kidneys: but in combination
with honey they are very good for gangrenous sores, and the
cancer known as “cacoethes.” The following is a method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>
adopted for the cure of all kinds of warts: on the first day of
the moon, each wart must be touched with a single chickpea,
after which, the party must tie up the pease in a linen cloth,
and throw it behind him; by adopting this plan, it is thought,
the warts will be made to disappear.</p>

<p>Our authors recommend the plant known as the “arietinum”<a id="FNanchor_2806_2806"></a><a href="#Footnote_2806_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a>
to be boiled in water with salt, and two cyathi of the decoction
to be taken for strangury. Employed in a similar manner, it
expels calculi, and cures jaundice. The water in which the
leaves and stalks of this plant have been boiled, applied as a
fomentation as hot as possible, allays gout in the feet, an effect
equally produced by the plant itself, beaten up and applied
warm. A decoction of the columbine<a id="FNanchor_2807_2807"></a><a href="#Footnote_2807_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a> chickpea, it is thought,
moderates the shivering fits in tertian or quartan fevers; and
the black kind, beaten up with half a nut-gall, and applied
with raisin wine, is a cure for ulcers of the eyes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_73"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 73.—THE FITCH: TWENTY REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In speaking of the fitch,<a id="FNanchor_2808_2808"></a><a href="#Footnote_2808_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a> we have mentioned certain properties
belonging to it; and, indeed, the ancients have attributed
to it no fewer virtues than they have to the cabbage.
For the stings of serpents, it is employed with vinegar; as
also for bites inflicted by crocodiles and human beings. If a
person eats of it, fasting, every day, according to authors of
the very highest authority, the spleen will gradually diminish.
The meal of it removes spots on the face and other parts of the
body. It prevents ulcers from spreading also, and is extremely
efficacious for affections of the mamill&aelig;: mixed with wine, it
makes carbuncles break. Parched, and taken with a piece of
honey the size of a hazel nut, it cures dysuria, flatulency,
affections of the liver, tenesmus, and that state of the body in
which no nourishment is derived from the food, generally known
as “atrophy.” For cutaneous eruptions, plasters are made of
it boiled with honey, being left to remain four days on the part
affected. Applied with honey, it prevents inflamed tumours
from suppurating. A decoction of it, employed as a fomentation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>
cures chilblains and prurigo; and it is thought by some,
that if it is taken daily, fasting, it will improve the complexion
of all parts of the body.</p>

<p>Used as an aliment, this pulse is far from wholesome,<a id="FNanchor_2809_2809"></a><a href="#Footnote_2809_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a> being
apt to produce vomiting, disorder the bowels, and stuff the
head and stomach. It weakens the knees also; but the effects
of it may be modified by keeping it in soak for several days, in
which case it is remarkably beneficial for oxen and beasts of
burden. The pods of it, beaten up green with the stalks and
leaves, before they harden, stain the hair black.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_74"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 74.—LUPINES: THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>There are wild lupines,<a id="FNanchor_2810_2810"></a><a href="#Footnote_2810_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a> also, inferior in every respect to
the cultivated kinds, except in their bitterness. Of all the
alimentary substances, there are none which are less heavy or
more useful<a id="FNanchor_2811_2811"></a><a href="#Footnote_2811_2811" class="fnanchor">2811</a> than dried lupines. Their bitterness is considerably
modified by cooking them on hot ashes, or steeping them
in hot water. Employed frequently as an article of food, they
impart freshness to the colour; the bitter lupine, too, is good for
the sting of the asp. Dried lupines, stripped of the husk and
pounded, are applied in a linen cloth to black ulcers, in which
they make new flesh: boiled in vinegar, they disperse scrofulous
sores and imposthumes of the parotid glands. A decoction
of them, with rue and pepper, is given in fever even, as
an expellent of intestinal worms,<a id="FNanchor_2812_2812"></a><a href="#Footnote_2812_2812" class="fnanchor">2812</a> to patients under thirty
years of age. For children, also, they are applied to the stomach
as a vermifuge, the patient fasting in the meantime: and,
according to another mode of treatment, they are parched and
taken in boiled must or in honey.</p>

<p>Lupines have the effect of stimulating the appetite, and of
dispelling nausea. The meal of them, kneaded up with vinegar,
and applied in the bath, removes pimples and prurigo;
employed alone, it dries up ulcerous sores. It cures bruises
also, and, used with polenta, allays inflammations. The wild
lupine is found to be the most efficacious for debility of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
hips and loins. A decoction of them, used as a fomentation,
removes freckles and improves the skin; and lupines,
either wild or cultivated, boiled down to the consistency of
honey, are a cure for black eruptions and leprosy. An application
of cultivated lupines causes carbuncles to break, and reduces
inflamed tumours and scrofulous sores, or else brings them
to a head: boiled in vinegar, they restore the flesh when cicatrized
to its proper colour. Thoroughly boiled in rain-water,
the decoction of them furnishes a detersive medicine, of which
fomentations are made for gangrenes, purulent eruptions, and
running ulcers. This decoction is very good, taken in drink,
for affections of the spleen, and with honey, for retardations of
the catamenia. Beaten up raw, with dried figs, lupines are
applied externally to the spleen. A decoction of the root acts
as a diuretic.</p>

<p>The herb cham&aelig;leon,<a id="FNanchor_2813_2813"></a><a href="#Footnote_2813_2813" class="fnanchor">2813</a> also, is boiled with lupines, and the
water of it strained off, to be used as a potion for cattle.
Lupines boiled in amurca,<a id="FNanchor_2814_2814"></a><a href="#Footnote_2814_2814" class="fnanchor">2814</a> or a decoction of them mixed with
amurca, heals the itch in beasts. The smoke of lupines kills<a id="FNanchor_2815_2815"></a><a href="#Footnote_2815_2815" class="fnanchor">2815</a>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_75"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 75.—IRIO, OR ERYSIMUM, BY THE GAULS CALLED VELA:
FIFTEEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>When treating of the cereals, we have already stated<a id="FNanchor_2816_2816"></a><a href="#Footnote_2816_2816" class="fnanchor">2816</a> that
the irio, which strongly resembles sesame, is also called “erysimon”
by the Greeks: the Gauls give it the name of “vela.”
It is a branchy plant, with leaves like those of rocket, but a
little narrower, and a seed similar to that of nasturtium. With
honey, it is extremely good for cough and purulent expectorations:
it is given, also, for jaundice and affections of the loins,
pleurisy, gripings of the bowels, and cœliac affections, and is
used in liniments for imposthumes of the parotid glands and carcinomatous
affections. Employed with water, or with honey,
it is useful for inflammations of the testes, and is extremely
beneficial for the diseases of infants. Mixed with honey and
figs, it is good for affections of the fundament and diseases of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span>
the joints; and taken in drink, it is an excellent antidote to
poisons. It is used, also, for asthma,<a id="FNanchor_2817_2817"></a><a href="#Footnote_2817_2817" class="fnanchor">2817</a> and with stale axle-grease
for fistulas; but it must not be allowed to touch the
interior of them.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_76"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 76.—HORMINUM: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Horminum resembles cummin, as already stated,<a id="FNanchor_2818_2818"></a><a href="#Footnote_2818_2818" class="fnanchor">2818</a> in its
seed; but in other respects, it is like the leek.<a id="FNanchor_2819_2819"></a><a href="#Footnote_2819_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a> It grows to
some nine inches in height, and there are two varieties of it.
In one of these the seed is oblong, and darker than that of the
other, and the plant itself is in request as an aphrodisiac, and
for the cure of argema and albugo in the eyes: of the other
kind the seed is whiter, and of a rounder form. Both kinds,
pounded and applied with water, are used for the extraction
of thorns from the body. The leaves, steeped in vinegar, disperse
tumours, either used by themselves, or in combination
with honey; they are employed, also, to disperse boils, before
they have come to a head, and other collections of acrid humours.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXII_CHAP_77"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 77.—DARNEL: FIVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Even more than this—the very plants which are the bane of
the corn-field are not without their medicinal uses. Darnel<a id="FNanchor_2820_2820"></a><a href="#Footnote_2820_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a>
has received from Virgil<a id="FNanchor_2821_2821"></a><a href="#Footnote_2821_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a> the epithet of “unhappy;” and yet,
ground and boiled with vinegar, it is used as an application for
the cure of impetigo, which is the more speedily effected the
oftener the application is renewed. It is employed, also, with
oxymel, for the cure of gout and other painful diseases. The
following is the mode of treatment: for one sextarius of vinegar,
two ounces of honey is the right proportion; three sextarii
having been thus prepared, two sextarii of darnel meal
are boiled down in it to a proper consistency, the mixture being
applied warm to the part affected. This meal, too, is used for
the extraction of splinters of broken bones.</p>

is a kind of oat which grows among corn, to which it is injurious;
the leaves and stalk of it resemble those of wheat, and
at the extremity it bears seeds, hanging down, something like
small locusts<a id="FNanchor_2824_2824"></a><a href="#Footnote_2824_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a> in appearance. The seed of this plant is useful

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_1"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 1. (1.)—INTRODUCTION.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now set forth the various properties, medicinal or
otherwise, as well of the cereals as of the other productions
which lie upon<a id="FNanchor_2833_2833"></a><a href="#Footnote_2833_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a> the surface of the earth, for the purpose either
of serving us for food, or for the gratification of our senses
with their flowers or perfumes. In the trees, however,
Pomona has entered the lists with them, and has imparted
certain medicinal properties to the fruits as they hang. Not content
with protecting and nourishing, under the shadow of the
trees, the various plants which we have<a id="FNanchor_2834_2834"></a><a href="#Footnote_2834_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a> already described,
she would even appear to be indignant, as it were, at the
thought that we should derive more succour from those productions
which are further removed from the canopy of heaven,
and which have only come into use in times comparatively recent.
For she bids man bear in mind that it was the fruits of
the trees which formed his first nourishment, and that it was
these which first led him to look upwards towards the heavens:
and not only this, but she reminds him, too, that even still it
is quite possible for him to derive his aliment from the trees,
without being indebted to grain for his subsistence.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_2"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 2.—THE VINE.</span></h3></div>

<p>But, by Hercules! it is the vine more particularly to which
she has accorded these medicinal properties, as though she
were not contented with her generosity in providing it with
such delicious flavours, and perfumes, and essences, in its omphacium,
its œnanthe, and its massaris, preparations upon
which we have already<a id="FNanchor_2835_2835"></a><a href="#Footnote_2835_2835" class="fnanchor">2835</a> enlarged. “It is to me,” she says,
“that man is indebted for the greater part of his enjoyments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span>
it is I that produce for him the flowing wine and the trickling
oil, it is I that ripen the date and other fruits in numbers so
varied; and all this, not insisting, like the earth, on their purchase
at the cost of fatigues and labours. No necessity do I
create for ploughing with the aid of oxen, for beating out
upon the threshing-floor, or for bruising under the millstone,
and all in order that man may earn his food at some indefinite
time by this vast expenditure of toil. As for me, all my gifts
are presented to him ready prepared: for no anxieties or
fatigues do they call, but, on the contrary, they offer themselves
spontaneously, and even fall to the ground, if man
should be too indolent to reach them as they hang.” Vying
even with herself, Pomona has done still more for our practical
advantage than for the mere gratification of our pleasures
and caprices.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_3"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 3.—THE LEAVES AND SHOOTS OF THE VINE: SEVEN
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p><a id="FNanchor_2836_2836"></a><a href="#Footnote_2836_2836" class="fnanchor">2836</a>
The leaves and shoots of the vine, employed with polenta,
allay head-ache and reduce inflammations:<a id="FNanchor_2837_2837"></a><a href="#Footnote_2837_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a> the leaves, too,
applied by themselves with cold water, are good for burning
pains in the stomach; and, used with barley-meal, are excellent
applications for diseases of the joints. The shoots, beaten
up and applied, have the property of drying up all kinds of
running tumours, and the juice extracted from them is used
as an injection for the cure of dysentery. The tears of the
vine, which would appear to be a sort of gum, will heal leprous
sores, lichens, and itch-scabs, if treated first with nitre:
used with oil, and applied frequently to superfluous hairs, they
act as a depilatory, those more particularly which exude from
the vine when burnt in a green state: this last liquid has the
effect, too, of removing warts. An infusion of the shoots in
water, taken in drink, is good for persons troubled with spitting
of blood, and for the fainting fits which sometimes ensue upon
conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<p>The bark of the vine and the dried leaves arrest the flowing
of blood from wounds, and make the sores cicatrize more
rapidly. The juice of the white vine,<a id="FNanchor_2838_2838"></a><a href="#Footnote_2838_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a> extracted from it while
green, effectually removes cutaneous<a id="FNanchor_2839_2839"></a><a href="#Footnote_2839_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a> eruptions. The ashes<a id="FNanchor_2840_2840"></a><a href="#Footnote_2840_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a>
of the cuttings of vines, and of the husks of the grapes, applied
with vinegar, are curative of condylomata and diseases
of the fundament; as also of sprains, burns, and swellings of
the spleen, applied with rose-oil, rue, and vinegar. Used with
wine, but without oil, they make a fomentation for erysipelas
and parts of the body which are chafed; they act as a depilatory
also.<a id="FNanchor_2841_2841"></a><a href="#Footnote_2841_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a> For affections of the spleen the ashes of vine-cuttings,
moistened with vinegar, are administered in drink,
being taken in doses of two cyathi in warm water; after which
the patient must take due care to lie upon the side in which
the spleen is situate.</p>

<p>The tendrils, too, which the vine throws out as it climbs,
beaten up in water and drunk, have the effect of arresting
habitual vomiting. The ashes of the vine, used with stale
axle-grease, are good for tumours, act as a detergent upon fistulas,
and speedily effect a radical cure; the same, too, with
pains and contractions of the sinews, occasioned by cold. Applied
with oil, they are useful for contusions, and with vinegar
and nitre, for fleshy excrescences upon the bones: in combination
with oil, they are good, too, for wounds inflicted by scorpions
and dogs. The ashes of the bark, employed by themselves,
restore the hair to such parts of the body as have suffered
from the action of fire.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_4"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 4.—OMPHACIUM EXTRACTED FROM THE VINE: FOURTEEN

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_2842_2842"></a><a href="#Footnote_2842_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a> mentioned, when speaking of the composition
of unguents, how omphacium is made from the grape,

of the humid parts of the body, such as the mouth, tonsillary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>
glands, and generative organs, for example; it is very good,
too, for the sight, for rough spots upon the eyelids, ulcers at the
corners of the eyes, films upon the eyes, running sores on all
parts of the body, cicatrizations<a id="FNanchor_2843_2843"></a><a href="#Footnote_2843_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a> slow in forming, and purulent
discharges from the ears. The powerful action of omphacium
is modified by the admixture of honey or raisin wine. It is

The most esteemed kind is that of Syria, the produce of the
white vine<a id="FNanchor_2845_2845"></a><a href="#Footnote_2845_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a> in the vicinity of the mountains of Antiochia and
Laodicea in particular. Being of a cooling, astringent nature,
it is used for sprinkling upon sores, and is employed as a topical
application for diseases of the stomach. It acts also as a
diuretic, and is good for maladies of the liver, head-ache,
dysentery, cœliac affections, and attacks of cholera: for nausea,
it is taken in doses of one obolus in vinegar. It acts as a desiccative
upon running eruptions of the head, and is extremely
efficacious for maladies of the humid parts of the body; hence
it is that it is employed, with honey and saffron, for ulcers of
the mouth, and for diseases of the generative organs and the
fundament. It arrests looseness of the bowels, and heals eruptions
of the eyelids and runnings at the eyes: taken with wine,
it cures derangements of the stomach, and with cold water,
spitting of blood.</p>

<p>The ashes of œnanthe are highly esteemed as an ingredient
in eye-salves, and as a detergent for ulcers, whitlows, and
hang-nails;<a id="FNanchor_2846_2846"></a><a href="#Footnote_2846_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a> to obtain these ashes, it is put into an oven, and

attached to all these preparations is due solely to the innate
greediness of mankind, which has racked its invention to gather
the productions of the earth before they have arrived at maturity.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_6"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 6.—GRAPES, FRESH GATHERED.</span></h3></div>

<p>As to grapes when allowed to gain maturity, the black ones
have more marked properties<a id="FNanchor_2848_2848"></a><a href="#Footnote_2848_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a> than the others; and hence it
is, that the wine made from them is not so agreeable. The
white grapes, on the other hand, are sweeter, for, being transparent,
the air penetrates them with greater facility.</p>

<p>Grapes fresh gathered are productive of flatulency, and disturb
the stomach and bowels; hence it is that they are avoided
in fevers, in large quantities more particularly. Indeed, they
are very apt to produce oppression of the head, and to bring on
the malady known as lethargy.<a id="FNanchor_2849_2849"></a><a href="#Footnote_2849_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a> Grapes which have been

the exposure to the air rendering them beneficial even to

<p>Grapes which have been preserved in wine or in must are
trying to the head. Next to the grapes which have been left
to hang in the air, are those which have been kept in chaff;
but as to those which have been preserved among grape husks,
they are injurious<a id="FNanchor_2851_2851"></a><a href="#Footnote_2851_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a> to the head, the bladder, and the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span>
though at the same time they arrest looseness of the bowels,
and are extremely good for patients troubled with spitting of
blood. When preserved in must, they are worse even in their
effects than when kept among husks; boiled<a id="FNanchor_2852_2852"></a><a href="#Footnote_2852_2852" class="fnanchor">2852</a> must, too, renders
them injurious to the stomach. It is the opinion of medical
writers, that grapes kept<a id="FNanchor_2853_2853"></a><a href="#Footnote_2853_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a> in rain-water are the most wholesome
of all, even though they are by no means agreeable eating;
for the benefit of them is particularly experienced in burning
pains of the stomach, biliousness arising from a disordered liver,
vomiting of bile, and attacks of cholera, as also dropsy and
burning fevers.</p>

<p>Grapes kept in earthen pots sharpen the taste, the stomach,
and the appetite; it is thought, however, that they are rendered
a little heavy<a id="FNanchor_2854_2854"></a><a href="#Footnote_2854_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a> by the exhalations from the husks with

They are used with panax,<a id="FNanchor_2865_2865"></a><a href="#Footnote_2865_2865" class="fnanchor">2865</a> for gout and loose nails; and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_13"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 13.—THE ASTAPHISAGRIA, OTHERWISE CALLED STAPHIS OR

<p>The wild astaphis, otherwise called staphis,<a id="FNanchor_2866_2866"></a><a href="#Footnote_2866_2866" class="fnanchor">2866</a> is by some persons
erroneously called “uva taminia;”<a id="FNanchor_2867_2867"></a><a href="#Footnote_2867_2867" class="fnanchor">2867</a> for it is altogether a
distinct plant from the other. It has a black, upright stem, with
leaves resembling those of the labrusca,<a id="FNanchor_2868_2868"></a><a href="#Footnote_2868_2868" class="fnanchor">2868</a> and bears what we may
call a pod,<a id="FNanchor_2869_2869"></a><a href="#Footnote_2869_2869" class="fnanchor">2869</a> rather than a grape, green, similar to a chick-pea
in appearance, and enclosing a kernel of triangular form. The
fruit of it ripens with the vintage and turns black, while the
berries of the taminia,<a id="FNanchor_2870_2870"></a><a href="#Footnote_2870_2870" class="fnanchor">2870</a> as is well known, are red; this last,
too, as we are aware, grows only in shaded spots, while the
wild astaphis, on the other hand, loves a site that is exposed
to the sun.</p>

<p>I would not recommend any one to use the kernels<a id="FNanchor_2871_2871"></a><a href="#Footnote_2871_2871" class="fnanchor">2871</a> of the
wild astaphis as a purgative, as it is very doubtful whether they
might not choke the patient; nor would I advise them to be
employed for the purpose of attenuating the phlegm, as they
are extremely irritating to the throat. Beaten up, however, and
applied topically, they kill vermin<a id="FNanchor_2872_2872"></a><a href="#Footnote_2872_2872" class="fnanchor">2872</a> in the head and other parts
of the body, more particularly if they are used with sandarach;
they are very useful, too, for itch-scabs and prurigo. A
decoction of the kernels is made with vinegar, for the cure of
tooth-ache, diseases of the ears, cicatrices<a id="FNanchor_2873_2873"></a><a href="#Footnote_2873_2873" class="fnanchor">2873</a> that are slow in
healing, and running sores.</p>

<p>The blossoms of the plant are beaten up and taken in wine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>
for stings<a id="FNanchor_2874_2874"></a><a href="#Footnote_2874_2874" class="fnanchor">2874</a> inflicted by serpents; but, as to the seed, I would
strongly recommend its rejection, on account of its extremely
pungent properties. Some persons give to this plant the name
of “pituitaria,”<a id="FNanchor_2875_2875"></a><a href="#Footnote_2875_2875" class="fnanchor">2875</a> and use it as a common application for

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_14"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 14.—THE LABRUSCA, OR WILD VINE: TWELVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The labrusca, too, produces an œnanthe, which has been
described at sufficient length already:<a id="FNanchor_2876_2876"></a><a href="#Footnote_2876_2876" class="fnanchor">2876</a> by the Greeks the labrusca
is known as the wild vine.<a id="FNanchor_2877_2877"></a><a href="#Footnote_2877_2877" class="fnanchor">2877</a> The leaves of it are thick
and of a whitish colour, the stem is jointed, and the bark full
of fissures: it bears grapes of a scarlet<a id="FNanchor_2878_2878"></a><a href="#Footnote_2878_2878" class="fnanchor">2878</a> hue, like the coccus,
which are made use of by females for the purpose of improving
the complexion, and removing spots upon the face. Pounded
with the leaves and the juice extracted from the tree, these
grapes are usefully employed for the treatment of lumbago
and sciatica. A decoction of the root<a id="FNanchor_2879_2879"></a><a href="#Footnote_2879_2879" class="fnanchor">2879</a> in water, taken in two
cyathi of Coan wine, promotes an alvine evacuation of aqueous
secretions; for which reason it is prescribed for dropsy.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that this is the plant that is commonly
known as the “uva taminia;”<a id="FNanchor_2880_2880"></a><a href="#Footnote_2880_2880" class="fnanchor">2880</a> it is in great request as
an amulet, and is employed, though as a gargle only, in cases
of spitting blood; for which purpose, salt, thyme, and oxymel
are added to it, care being taken not to swallow any of the
mixture. It is generally looked upon as unsafe to employ it as
a purgative.</p>

growing in willow-beds; for which reason it is known by a
distinct name, though the uses to which it is applied are just

OR MADON: THIRTY-ONE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The white vine<a id="FNanchor_2882_2882"></a><a href="#Footnote_2882_2882" class="fnanchor">2882</a> is known to the Greeks by the various
names of ampeloleuce, staphyle, melothron, psilotrum, archezostis,
cedrostis, and madon. The twigs of this tree are
jointed, thin, and climbing, with considerable interstices between
the knots.<a id="FNanchor_2883_2883"></a><a href="#Footnote_2883_2883" class="fnanchor">2883</a> The leaves, attached to the numerous
shoots, and about the size of an ivy leaf, are jagged at the
edges, like that of the vine. The root of it is large and white,
and very like a radish<a id="FNanchor_2884_2884"></a><a href="#Footnote_2884_2884" class="fnanchor">2884</a> at first; from it issue several stems,
similar to asparagus in appearance. These stems, eaten boiled,
are both purgative and diuretic. The leaves, too, as well as
the stems, are possessed of caustic<a id="FNanchor_2885_2885"></a><a href="#Footnote_2885_2885" class="fnanchor">2885</a> properties; for which
reason they are employed topically with salt, for phaged&aelig;nic
sores, gangrenes, and putrid ulcers of the legs. The fruit of
the tree is in the form of grapes thinly scattered, the juice of
which is red at first, and afterwards of a saffron colour. This
fruit<a id="FNanchor_2886_2886"></a><a href="#Footnote_2886_2886" class="fnanchor">2886</a> is well known to curriers, who are in the habit of using
it in preparing leather. It is employed also in the form of a
liniment for itch-scabs and leprous spots; and a decoction of
it with wheat, taken in drink, increases the milk in women
when nursing. The root of this tree, so renowned for
the numerous medicinal purposes to which it is applied, is
pounded and taken in wine, in doses of two drachm&aelig;, for the
cure of stings inflicted by serpents:<a id="FNanchor_2887_2887"></a><a href="#Footnote_2887_2887" class="fnanchor">2887</a> it has the effect, also, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>
removing spots upon the face, moles and freckles, as well as
scars and bruises: a decoction of it in oil is productive of a
similar effect. A decoction of it is given to drink for epilepsy,<a id="FNanchor_2888_2888"></a><a href="#Footnote_2888_2888" class="fnanchor">2888</a>
and to persons troubled with a disordered mind or
suffering from vertigo, the dose being one drachma daily, for a
whole year: taken in larger quantities, it is apt sometimes to
disorder<a id="FNanchor_2889_2889"></a><a href="#Footnote_2889_2889" class="fnanchor">2889</a> the senses. It is possessed, also, of one very remarkable
property, applied with water in the same manner as
bryonia, of extracting splintered bones, for which reason it is
known to some persons by the name of white bryonia: the
other kind, however, which is black, is found to answer
the purpose better, in combination with honey and frankincense.</p>

<p>The white vine disperses incipient suppurations, ripens
them when they are inveterate, and acts as a detergent: it
operates also as an emmenagogue and diuretic. An electuary
is prepared from it for asthma and pains in the sides, as
also for convulsions and ruptures. Taken in drink for thirty
days together, in doses of three oboli, it has the effect of reducing
the spleen; and it is used, in combination with figs,
for the cure of hangnails<a id="FNanchor_2890_2890"></a><a href="#Footnote_2890_2890" class="fnanchor">2890</a> on the fingers. Applied with wine,
it brings away the after-birth, and, taken in hydromel, in
doses of one drachma, it carries off phlegm. The juice of the
root should be extracted before the fruit ripens; applied either
by itself or with meal of fitches, it imparts an improved complexion
and a certain degree of suppleness to the skin: it has
the effect also of repelling serpents. The root itself, too,
beaten up with a pulpy fig, will remove wrinkles on the body,
if the person using it takes care to walk a couple of stadia immediately
after the application; otherwise it would leave marks
upon the skin, unless, indeed, it were washed off immediately
with cold water. The black vine, too, is better for this purpose
than the white one, as the latter is very apt to be productive
of itching.</p>

<p>For there is also a black vine, properly known as the “bryonia,”<a id="FNanchor_2891_2891"></a><a href="#Footnote_2891_2891" class="fnanchor">2891</a>
though by some persons it is called the “chironia,”

from the one previously mentioned in its colour, which, as
already stated,<a id="FNanchor_2892_2892"></a><a href="#Footnote_2892_2892" class="fnanchor">2892</a> is black. The shoots of this tree, which
resemble asparagus in appearance, are preferred by Diocles for
eating to real asparagus,<a id="FNanchor_2893_2893"></a><a href="#Footnote_2893_2893" class="fnanchor">2893</a> as a diuretic and for its property of
reducing the spleen. It is found growing in shrubberies or
reed-beds more particularly. The root of it, which is black
outside, and of the colour of box within, is even more efficacious
for the extraction of splintered bones than the plant last mentioned;
in addition to which, it has the property of being a
specific for excoriations of the neck in cattle. It is said, too,
that if a person plants it around a farm, it will be sure to
keep hawks away, and to preserve the poultry-yard<a id="FNanchor_2894_2894"></a><a href="#Footnote_2894_2894" class="fnanchor">2894</a> in perfect
safety. Attached to the ankles, it tends to disperse the blood,
congested or otherwise, which may have settled in those
parts of the body, whether in human beings or in beasts of
burden.</p>

<p>The various kinds of must<a id="FNanchor_2895_2895"></a><a href="#Footnote_2895_2895" class="fnanchor">2895</a> have different properties; some
of them being black, some white, and others of intermediate
shades of colour. There is a difference, too, between the kinds
of must from which wine is made, and those from which
raisin wine is prepared. The various degrees of care and attention
on the part of the maker, render the differences that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span>
already exist, quite innumerable; we shall therefore content
ourselves with taking a general view only of their medicinal
uses.</p>

<p>Every kind of must is unwholesome to the stomach, but of
a soothing nature to the venous system. Taken off at a draught,
immediately after the bath, must is fatal<a id="FNanchor_2896_2896"></a><a href="#Footnote_2896_2896" class="fnanchor">2896</a> in its effects. It
acts as an antidote<a id="FNanchor_2897_2897"></a><a href="#Footnote_2897_2897" class="fnanchor">2897</a> to cantharides and stings inflicted by serpents,
those of the h&aelig;morrhois and the salamandra<a id="FNanchor_2898_2898"></a><a href="#Footnote_2898_2898" class="fnanchor">2898</a> in particular.
It is productive of head-ache, and is prejudicial to the
throat, but it is good for the kidneys, liver, and inner coat of
the bladder, by reason of its lubricating properties. It is particularly
effectual also in cases of injuries inflicted by the insect
known as the “buprestis.”<a id="FNanchor_2899_2899"></a><a href="#Footnote_2899_2899" class="fnanchor">2899</a></p>

or beneficial. And then, in addition to this, how very uncertain
is it, whether, the moment we have drunk it, it will be
productive of salutary results, or turn out no better than so
much poison! However, it is only with reference to its medicinal
properties, that we are now about to speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span></p>

<p>Asclepiades has composed a whole treatise (which has
thence received its name<a id="FNanchor_2904_2904"></a><a href="#Footnote_2904_2904" class="fnanchor">2904</a>) on the proper methods of administering
wine; and the number of commentators who have since
written on this treatise, is almost innumerable. For my own
part, with all that gravity which becomes a Roman, and one
zealous for the furtherance of liberal pursuits, I shall enter into a
careful examination of this subject, not, indeed, in the character
of a physician, but as a careful investigator of the
effects which wine is likely to produce upon the health of mankind.
To treat, however, of the medicinal properties of each
individual kind, would be a labour without end, and quite inexhaustible;
the more so, as the opinions of medical men are
so entirely at variance upon the subject.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_20"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 20.—THE SURRENTINE WINES: THREE REMEDIES. THE
ALBAN WINES: TWO REMEDIES. THE FALERNIAN WINES: SIX
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Our ancestors set the highest value upon the wines of
Surrentum;<a id="FNanchor_2905_2905"></a><a href="#Footnote_2905_2905" class="fnanchor">2905</a> but at a later period the preference was given
to the Alban, or the Falernian wines. More recently, again,
other varieties of wine have come into fashion, quite in accordance
with that most unreasonable mode of proceeding, according
to which, each person, as he finds a wine most to his
taste, extols it as superior to all others. Suppose, now, that all
persons were quite agreed as to the superiority of some particular
kind of wine, how small a proportion of mankind
would be enabled to make use of it! As it is, even the rich never
drink it in an unsophisticated state; the morals of the age
being such, that it is the name only of a vintage that is sold,
the wines being adulterated the very moment they enter the
vat. Hence it is, by Hercules!—a thing truly astounding—that,
in reality, a wine is more innoxious in its effects, in proportion
as it enjoys a less extended renown. The three kinds,
however, of which we have made mention, appear to have
maintained, with the least diminution, their ancient repute.</p>

<p>The Falernian wine, if a person should be desirous to know
the marked characteristics of wines according to age, is injurious
to the health, either too new or too old; at fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span>
years it begins to be of medium age. Falernian wine of this
age, taken cold, is good for the stomach, but not when taken
warm. For an inveterate cough and for quartan fevers, it is
a good plan to drink it neat, fasting. There is no wine that
quickens the action of the venous system so much as this; it
acts astringently upon the bowels, and is feeding to the body.
It has been thought, however, that this wine is productive of
injury to the sight, and that it is far from beneficial to the
nerves<a id="FNanchor_2906_2906"></a><a href="#Footnote_2906_2906" class="fnanchor">2906</a> and the bladder.</p>

<p>The Alban wines are more salutary to the nervous system,
but the sweet kinds are not so beneficial to the stomach. The
rough wines of Alba are even better than those of Falernum,
but they do not promote the digestion so well, and have a
slight tendency to overload the stomach.</p>

<p>As to the Surrentine wines, they have no such effect upon
the stomach, nor are they at all trying to the head; they have
the property also of arresting defluxions of the stomach and
intestines. The C&aelig;cuban wines are no longer grown.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_21"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 21.—THE SETINE WINES; ONE OBSERVATION UPON THEM.
THE STATAN WINES; ONE OBSERVATION UPON THEM. THE
SIGNIAN WINES; ONE REMEDY.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the wines, however, which still exist, those of Setia<a id="FNanchor_2907_2907"></a><a href="#Footnote_2907_2907" class="fnanchor">2907</a>
promote the digestion, having more strength than the Surrentine
wines, and more roughness than those of Alba. The
wines of Falernum are not so powerful. Those of Stata are
but very little inferior in quality to the wines already mentioned.
It is universally agreed that the wines of Signia are
extremely beneficial in cases of derangement of the bowels.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_22"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 22.—OTHER WINES: SIXTY-FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>As to the other wines, they may be spoken of in general
terms. By the use of wine, the human vigour, blood, and
complexion are improved. It is wine that makes up for all
the difference between the middle or temperate zone, and those
which lie on either side of it, the juice of the vine conferring
as much vigour and robustness upon the inhabitants of our
part of the earth as the rigorousness<a id="FNanchor_2908_2908"></a><a href="#Footnote_2908_2908" class="fnanchor">2908</a> of the climate does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span>
upon the people there. Milk, used as a beverage, strengthens,
the bones, liquids extracted from the cereals nourish the
sinews, and water imparts nutriment to the flesh: hence it is
that persons who confine themselves to these several liquids as
a beverage, are of a less ruddy complexion than the wine-drinker,
less robust, and less able to endure fatigue. By the
use of wine in moderation the sinews are strengthened, but
taken in excess it proves injurious to them; the same, too,
with the eyes. Wine refreshes the stomach, sharpens the
appetite, takes off the keen edge of sorrows and anxieties,
warms the body, acts beneficially as a diuretic, and invites
sleep. In addition to these properties, it arrests vomiting, and
we find that pledgets of wool, soaked in wine, and applied to
abscesses, are extremely beneficial. According to Asclepiades,
the virtues possessed by wine are hardly equalled by the majestic
attributes of the gods themselves.</p>

<p>Old wine bears admixture with a larger quantity of water, and
acts more powerfully as a diuretic, though at the same time it
is less effectual for quenching thirst. Sweet wine, again, is
less inebriating, but stays longer on the stomach, while rough
wine is more easy of digestion. The wine that becomes mellow
with the greatest rapidity is the lightest, and that which
becomes sweeter the older it is, is not so injurious to the
nerves. Wines that are rich and black,<a id="FNanchor_2909_2909"></a><a href="#Footnote_2909_2909" class="fnanchor">2909</a> are not so beneficial
to the stomach; but, at the same time, they are more
feeding to the body. Thin-bodied rough wines are not so
feeding, but are more wholesome to the stomach, and pass
off more speedily by urine, though they are all the more
liable to fly to the head; a remark which will apply, once for
all, to liquids of every kind.</p>

<p>Wine that has been mellowed by the agency of smoke is
extremely unwholesome—a fraudulent method of preparation
that has been invented in the wine-lofts<a id="FNanchor_2910_2910"></a><a href="#Footnote_2910_2910" class="fnanchor">2910</a> of the retail dealers.
At the present day, however, this plan is adopted in private
families even, when it is wished to give the appearance of maturity
to wines that have become carious.<a id="FNanchor_2911_2911"></a><a href="#Footnote_2911_2911" class="fnanchor">2911</a> Indeed, this term
carious has been used very appositely by the ancients with
reference to wines; for we find that in the case of wood even,
smoke exercises a caustic effect upon the carious parts, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">473</a></span>
eats them away; and yet we, on the other hand, persuade
ourselves that an adventitious age may he imparted to wines
by the bitter twang derived from smoke!<a id="FNanchor_2912_2912"></a><a href="#Footnote_2912_2912" class="fnanchor">2912</a></p>

<p>Those wines which are extremely pale, become more wholesome
the older they are. The more generous<a id="FNanchor_2913_2913"></a><a href="#Footnote_2913_2913" class="fnanchor">2913</a> a wine is, the
thicker it becomes with age; while, at the same time, it
contracts a bitter flavour, which is far from exercising a beneficial
effect upon the health. To season another wine, that is
not so old, with this, is nothing less than to make an unwholesome
preparation. The more of its own natural flavour<a id="FNanchor_2914_2914"></a><a href="#Footnote_2914_2914" class="fnanchor">2914</a> a
wine possesses, the more wholesome it is; and the best age for
a wine is that which naturally belongs to it, a medium age
being the one that is the most generally esteemed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_23"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 23.—SIXTY-ONE OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE TO WINE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Persons whose wish it is to make flesh, or to keep the bowels
relaxed, will do well to drink while taking their food. Those,
on the other hand, who wish to reduce themselves, or prevent
the bowels from being relaxed, should abstain from drinking
while taking their meals, and drink but a very little only
when they have done eating. To drink wine fasting is a
fashion of recent introduction<a id="FNanchor_2915_2915"></a><a href="#Footnote_2915_2915" class="fnanchor">2915</a> only, and an extremely bad
one for persons engaged in matters of importance, and requiring
a continued application of the mental faculties. Wine, no
doubt, was taken fasting in ancient times, but then it was as
a preparative for sleep and repose from worldly cares; and it
is for this reason that, in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_2916_2916"></a><a href="#Footnote_2916_2916" class="fnanchor">2916</a> we find Helen presenting
it to the guests before the repast. It is upon this fact, too,
that the common proverb is founded, which says that “wisdom
is obscured by wine.”<a id="FNanchor_2917_2917"></a><a href="#Footnote_2917_2917" class="fnanchor">2917</a> It is to wine that we men are
indebted for being the only animated beings that drink without
being thirsty. When drinking wine, it is a very good plan to
take a draught of water every now and then; and to take one
long draught of it at the last, cold water taken internally
having the effect of instantaneously dispelling inebriation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">474</a></span></p>

<p>It is strongly recommended by Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_2918_2918"></a><a href="#Footnote_2918_2918" class="fnanchor">2918</a> to drink undiluted
wine<a id="FNanchor_2919_2919"></a><a href="#Footnote_2919_2919" class="fnanchor">2919</a> for twenty days before the rising of the Dog-star, and
as many after. Pure wine, too, acts as an antidote to hemlock,
coriander,<a id="FNanchor_2920_2920"></a><a href="#Footnote_2920_2920" class="fnanchor">2920</a> henbane, mistletoe, opium, mercury, as also
to stings inflicted by bees, wasps, hornets, the phalangium,
serpents, and scorpions; all kinds of poison, in fact, which are
of a cold nature, the venom of the h&aelig;morrhois and the
prester,<a id="FNanchor_2921_2921"></a><a href="#Footnote_2921_2921" class="fnanchor">2921</a> in particular, and the noxious effects of fungi. Undiluted
wine is good, too, in cases of flatulency, gnawing pains
in the thoracic organs, excessive vomitings at the stomach,
fluxes of the bowels and intestines, dysentery, excessive perspirations
after prolonged fits of coughing, and defluxions of
various kinds. In the cardiac<a id="FNanchor_2922_2922"></a><a href="#Footnote_2922_2922" class="fnanchor">2922</a> disease, it is a good plan to
apply a sponge soaked in neat wine to the left breast: in all
these cases, however, old white wine is the best. A fomentation
of hot wine applied to the genitals of beasts of burden is
found to be very beneficial; and, introduced into the mouth,
with the aid of a horn, it has the effect of removing all sensations
of fatigue.<a id="FNanchor_2923_2923"></a><a href="#Footnote_2923_2923" class="fnanchor">2923</a> It is asserted that in apes, and other quadrupeds
with toes, the growth will be impeded if they are
accustomed to drink undiluted wine.<a id="FNanchor_2924_2924"></a><a href="#Footnote_2924_2924" class="fnanchor">2924</a></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_24"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 24.—IN WHAT MALADIES WINE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED;
HOW IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED, AND AT WHAT TIMES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We shall now proceed to speak of wine in relation to its
medicinal uses. The wines of Campania<a id="FNanchor_2925_2925"></a><a href="#Footnote_2925_2925" class="fnanchor">2925</a> which have the
least body, are the most wholesome beverage for persons of
rank and station; and for the lower classes<a id="FNanchor_2926_2926"></a><a href="#Footnote_2926_2926" class="fnanchor">2926</a> the best kind of
wine is that which is the most pleasant to the person who
drinks it, provided he is in robust health. For persons of all
ranks, however, the most serviceable wine is that the strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>
of which has been reduced by the strainer;<a id="FNanchor_2927_2927"></a><a href="#Footnote_2927_2927" class="fnanchor">2927</a> for we must bear
in mind that wine is nothing else but juice of grapes which
has acquired strength by the process of fermentation. A mixture
of numerous kinds of wine is universally bad, and the
most wholesome wine of all is that to which no ingredient has
been added when in a state of must; indeed, it is still better
if the vessels even in which it is kept have never been pitched.<a id="FNanchor_2928_2928"></a><a href="#Footnote_2928_2928" class="fnanchor">2928</a>
As to wines which have been treated with marble, gypsum,
or lime,<a id="FNanchor_2929_2929"></a><a href="#Footnote_2929_2929" class="fnanchor">2929</a> where is the man, however robust he may be, that
has not stood in dread of them?</p>

<p>Wines which have been prepared with sea-water<a id="FNanchor_2930_2930"></a><a href="#Footnote_2930_2930" class="fnanchor">2930</a> are particularly
injurious to the stomach, nerves, and bladder. Those
which have been seasoned with resin are generally looked
upon as beneficial to a cold stomach, but are considered unsuitable
where there is a tendency to vomit: the same, too, with
must, boiled grape-juice,<a id="FNanchor_2931_2931"></a><a href="#Footnote_2931_2931" class="fnanchor">2931</a> and raisin wine. New wines seasoned
with resin are good for no one, being productive of
vertigo and head-ache: hence it is that the name of “crapula”<a id="FNanchor_2932_2932"></a><a href="#Footnote_2932_2932" class="fnanchor">2932</a>
has been given equally to new resined wines, and to
the surfeit and head-ache which they produce.</p>

<p>The wines above mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2933_2933"></a><a href="#Footnote_2933_2933" class="fnanchor">2933</a> by name, are good for cough
and catarrh, as also for cœliac affections, dysentery, and
the catamenia. Those wines of this sort which are red<a id="FNanchor_2934_2934"></a><a href="#Footnote_2934_2934" class="fnanchor">2934</a> or
black,<a id="FNanchor_2935_2935"></a><a href="#Footnote_2935_2935" class="fnanchor">2935</a> are more astringent and more heating than the others.
Wines which have been seasoned with pitch only, are not so
injurious; but at the same time we must bear in mind that
pitch is neither more nor less than resin liquefied<a id="FNanchor_2936_2936"></a><a href="#Footnote_2936_2936" class="fnanchor">2936</a> by the action
of fire. These pitched wines are of a heating nature, promote
the digestion, and act as a purgative; they are good, also, for
the chest and the bowels, for pains in the uterus, if there are
no signs of fever, for inveterate fluxes, ulcerations, ruptures,
spasms, suppurated abscesses, debility of the sinews, flatulency,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>
cough, asthma, and sprains, in which last case they are applied
in uncleansed wool. For all these purposes the wine is preferred
which has naturally the flavour of pitch,<a id="FNanchor_2937_2937"></a><a href="#Footnote_2937_2937" class="fnanchor">2937</a> and is
thence known as “picatum:” it is generally agreed, however,
that the produce of the vine called “helvennaca,”<a id="FNanchor_2938_2938"></a><a href="#Footnote_2938_2938" class="fnanchor">2938</a> if taken in
too large a quantity, is trying to the head.</p>

<p>In reference to the treatment of fever, it is well known that
wine should never be given, unless the patient is an aged person,
or the symptoms are beginning to abate. In cases of acute
fever, wine must never be given, under any circumstance,
except when there is an evident remission of the attack, and
more particularly if this takes place in the night, for then the
danger is diminished by one half, there being the probability
of the patient sleeping off the effects of the wine. It is equally
forbidden, also, to females just after delivery or a miscarriage,
and to patients suffering from over-indulgence of the sexual
passions; nor should it be given in cases of head-ache, of
maladies in which the attacks are attended with chills at the
extremities, of fever accompanied with cough, of tremulousness<a id="FNanchor_2939_2939"></a><a href="#Footnote_2939_2939" class="fnanchor">2939</a>
in the sinews, of pains in the fauces, or where the disease
is found to concentrate itself in the iliac regions. Wine is
strictly forbidden, too, in cases of induration of the thoracic
organs, violent throbbings of the veins, opisthotony, tetanus,
asthma, and hardness of breathing attended with fever.</p>

<p>Wine is far from beneficial for a patient, when the eyes are
fixed and rigid, and when the eyelids are immoveable, or else
relaxed and heavy; in cases, too, where, with an incessant nictation,
the eyes are more than usually brilliant, or where the
eyelids refuse to close—the same, too, if that symptom
should occur in sleep—or where the eyes are suffused with
blood, or congealed matter makes its appearance in the corners
of those organs. The same rule should be observed, also, when
the tongue is heavy and swollen, or when there is an impediment
from time to time in the speech, when the urine is passed
with difficulty, or when a person has been seized with a sudden
fright, with spasms, or recurrent fits of torpor, or experiences
seminal discharges during sleep.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_25"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 25.—NINETY-ONE OBSERVATIONS WITH REFERENCE TO
WINE.</span></h3></div>

<p>It is a well-ascertained fact, that in the cardiac<a id="FNanchor_2940_2940"></a><a href="#Footnote_2940_2940" class="fnanchor">2940</a> disease the
only resource is wine. According to some authorities, however,
wine should only be given when the attacks come on,
while others, again, are of opinion, that it must only be administered
between the attacks; it being the object with the
former to arrest the profuse perspirations, while the latter base
their practice on an impression that it may be given with more
safety at a moment when the malady has diminished in intensity;
and this I find is the opinion entertained by most people.
In all cases, wine must only be administered just after taking
food, never after sleep, and under no circumstances after any
other kind of drink, or in other words, only when the patient
is thirsty; in no case whatever should it be given, except at the
very last extremity. Wine is better suited to males than to
females, to aged people than to youths, to youths than to children,
and to persons who are used to it than to those who are
not in the habit of taking it; winter, too, is a better time for
using it than summer. As to the quantity to be prescribed,
and the proportion of water to be mixed with it, that depends
entirely upon the strength of the wine; it is generally thought,
however, that the best proportions are one cyathus of wine and
two of water. If, however, there is a derangement of the
stomach, and if the food does not pass downward, the wine must
be given in a larger proportion.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_26"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 26.—ARTIFICIAL WINES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Among the artificial wines, the preparation of which we
have<a id="FNanchor_2941_2941"></a><a href="#Footnote_2941_2941" class="fnanchor">2941</a> described, [there are some which],<a id="FNanchor_2942_2942"></a><a href="#Footnote_2942_2942" class="fnanchor">2942</a> I think, are no
longer made; in addition to which, it would be a mere loss of
time to enlarge upon their medicinal effects, having expatiated
elsewhere upon the properties of the various elements of
which they are composed. And then, besides, the conceits of
the medical men in relation to these wines have really passed
all bounds; they pretend, for instance, that a wine extracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>
from turnips<a id="FNanchor_2943_2943"></a><a href="#Footnote_2943_2943" class="fnanchor">2943</a> is good for recruiting the exhausted strength,
after exercises in arms or on horseback; and, not to speak of
other preparations, they attribute a similar effect to wine of
juniper.<a id="FNanchor_2944_2944"></a><a href="#Footnote_2944_2944" class="fnanchor">2944</a> Who is there, too, that would think of looking,
upon wormwood wine<a id="FNanchor_2945_2945"></a><a href="#Footnote_2945_2945" class="fnanchor">2945</a> as superior in its effects to wormwood
itself?</p>

<p>I shall pass in silence the rest of these preparations, and
among them palm wine,<a id="FNanchor_2946_2946"></a><a href="#Footnote_2946_2946" class="fnanchor">2946</a> which is injurious to the head, and
is beneficial only as a laxative to the bowels, and as a cure for
spitting of blood. We cannot, however, look upon the liquor
which we have spoken of<a id="FNanchor_2947_2947"></a><a href="#Footnote_2947_2947" class="fnanchor">2947</a> under the name of “bion,” as being
an artificial wine; for the whole art of making it consists merely
in the employment of grapes before they have arrived at maturity.
This preparation is extremely good for a deranged
stomach or an imperfect digestion, as also for pregnancy, fainting
fits, paralysis, fits of trembling, vertigo, gripings of the
bowels, and sciatica. It is said, too, that in times of pestilence,
and for persons on a long journey, this liquid forms a
beverage of remarkable efficacy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_27"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 27.—VINEGAR: TWENTY-EIGHT REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Wine, even when it has lost its vinous properties, still retains
some medicinal virtues. Vinegar possesses cooling properties
in the very highest degree, and is no less efficacious as
a resolvent; it has the property, too, of effervescing,<a id="FNanchor_2948_2948"></a><a href="#Footnote_2948_2948" class="fnanchor">2948</a> when
poured upon the ground. We have frequently had occasion,
and shall again have occasion, to mention the various medicinal
compositions in which it forms an ingredient. Taken by itself,
it dispels nausea and arrests hiccup, and if smelt at, it will
prevent sneezing: retained in the mouth, it prevents a person
from being inconvenienced by the heat<a id="FNanchor_2949_2949"></a><a href="#Footnote_2949_2949" class="fnanchor">2949</a> of the bath. It is used
as a beverage also, in combination with water,<a id="FNanchor_2950_2950"></a><a href="#Footnote_2950_2950" class="fnanchor">2950</a> and employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>
as a gargle, it is found by many to be very wholesome to the
stomach, particularly convalescents and persons suffering from
sun-stroke; used as a fomentation, too, this mixture is extremely
beneficial to the eyes. Vinegar is used remedially
when a leech has been swallowed;<a id="FNanchor_2951_2951"></a><a href="#Footnote_2951_2951" class="fnanchor">2951</a> and it has the property of
healing leprous sores,<a id="FNanchor_2952_2952"></a><a href="#Footnote_2952_2952" class="fnanchor">2952</a> scorbutic eruptions, running ulcers,
wounds inflicted by dogs, scorpions, and scolopendr&aelig;, and the
bite of the shrew-mouse. It is good, too, as a preventive of the
itching sensations produced by the venom of all stinging animals,
and as an antidote to the bite of the millepede.</p>

<p>Applied warm in a sponge, in the proportion of three sextarii
to two ounces of sulphur or a bunch of hyssop, vinegar
is a remedy for maladies of the fundament. To arrest the
h&aelig;morrhage which ensues upon the operation<a id="FNanchor_2953_2953"></a><a href="#Footnote_2953_2953" class="fnanchor">2953</a> of lithotomy,
and, indeed, all other operations of a similar nature, it is usual
to apply vinegar in a sponge, and at the same time to administer
it internally in doses of two cyathi, the very strongest
possible being employed. Vinegar has the effect also of
dissolving coagulated blood; for the cure of lichens, it is used
both internally and externally. Used as an injection, it arrests
looseness of the bowels and fluxes of the intestines; it is
similarly employed, too, for procidence of the rectum and uterus.</p>

<p>Vinegar acts as a cure for inveterate coughs, defluxions of
the throat, hardness of breathing, and looseness of the teeth:
but it acts injuriously upon the bladder and the sinews, when
relaxed. Medical men were for a long time in ignorance how
beneficial vinegar is for the sting of the asp; for it was only
recently that a man, while carrying a bladder<a id="FNanchor_2954_2954"></a><a href="#Footnote_2954_2954" class="fnanchor">2954</a> of vinegar, happening
to be stung by an asp upon which he trod, found to his
surprise that whenever he put down the bladder he felt the sting,
but that when he took it up again, he seemed as though he
had never been hurt; a circumstance which at once suggested
to him the remedial properties of the vinegar, upon drinking
some of which he experienced a cure. It is with vinegar, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span>
and nothing else, that persons rinse the mouth after sucking
the poison from a wound. This liquid, in fact, exercises a
predominance not only upon various articles of food, but upon
many other substances as well. Poured upon rocks in considerable
quantities, it has the effect of splitting<a id="FNanchor_2955_2955"></a><a href="#Footnote_2955_2955" class="fnanchor">2955</a> them, when
the action of fire alone has been unable to produce any effect
thereon. As a seasoning, too, there is no kind that is more
agreeable than vinegar, or that has a greater tendency to
heighten the flavour of food. When it is employed for this
purpose, its extreme tartness is modified with burnt bread or
wine, or else it is heightened by the addition of pepper, and of
laser;<a id="FNanchor_2956_2956"></a><a href="#Footnote_2956_2956" class="fnanchor">2956</a> in all cases, too, salt modifies its strength.</p>

<p>While speaking of vinegar, we must not omit to mention a
very remarkable case in connexion with it: in the latter years
of his life, M. Agrippa was dreadfully afflicted with gout, so
much so, in fact, that he was quite unable to endure the torments
to which he was subjected. Upon this, guided by the
ominous advice of one of his medical attendants, though unknown
to Augustus, at the moment of an extremely severe
attack he plunged his legs into hot vinegar, content to purchase
exemption from such cruel torments as he suffered, if
even at the price of all use and sensation in those limbs,

<p>Squill vinegar is the more esteemed, the older it is. In
addition to the properties which we have already<a id="FNanchor_2958_2958"></a><a href="#Footnote_2958_2958" class="fnanchor">2958</a> mentioned,
it is useful in cases where the food turns sour upon the stomach,
a mere taste of it being sufficient to act as a corrective.
It is good, too, when persons are seized with vomiting, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>
fasting, having the effect of indurating the passages of the
throat and stomach. It is a corrective, also, of bad breath,
strengthens the teeth and gums, and improves the complexion.</p>

<p>Used as a gargle, squill vinegar remedies hardness of hearing,
and opens the passages of the ears, while at the same
time it tends to improve the sight. It is very good, too, for
epilepsy, melancholy, vertigo, hysterical suffocations, blows,
falls with violence, and extravasations of blood in consequence,
as also for debility of the sinews, and diseases of the kidneys.
In cases of internal ulceration, however, the use of it must be
avoided.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_29"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 29.—OXYMELI: SEVEN REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The following, as we learn from Dieuches, was the manner
in which oxymeli<a id="FNanchor_2959_2959"></a><a href="#Footnote_2959_2959" class="fnanchor">2959</a> was prepared by the ancients. In a cauldron
they used to put ten min&aelig; of honey, five hemin&aelig; of old
vinegar, a pound and a quarter of sea-salt, and five sextarii
of rain-water; the mixture was then boiled together till it
had simmered some ten times, after which it was poured off,
and put by for keeping. Asclepiades, however, condemned
this preparation, and put an end to the use of it, though before
his time it used to be given in fevers even. Still, however,
it is generally admitted that it was useful for the cure
of stings inflicted by the serpent known as the “seps”<a id="FNanchor_2960_2960"></a><a href="#Footnote_2960_2960" class="fnanchor">2960</a> and
that it acted as an antidote to opium<a id="FNanchor_2961_2961"></a><a href="#Footnote_2961_2961" class="fnanchor">2961</a> and mistletoe. It was
usefully employed also, warm, as a gargle for quinsy and
maladies of the ears, and for affections of the mouth and
throat; for all these purposes, however, at the present day,
oxalme is employed, the best kind of which is made with
salt and fresh vinegar.</p>

but must boiled down to one third: that which is prepared
from white must is the best. It is used medicinally in cases
of injuries inflicted by cantharides, the buprestis,<a id="FNanchor_2963_2963"></a><a href="#Footnote_2963_2963" class="fnanchor">2963</a> the pine

bites and stings. Taken with onions it has the effect
of bringing away the dead fœtus and the after-birth. According
to Fabianus, it acts as a poison, if taken by a person fasting,

<p>Next in the natural order come the lees of these several
liquids. The lees of<a id="FNanchor_2966_2966"></a><a href="#Footnote_2966_2966" class="fnanchor">2966</a> wine are so extremely powerful as to
prove fatal to persons on descending into the vats.<a id="FNanchor_2967_2967"></a><a href="#Footnote_2967_2967" class="fnanchor">2967</a> The
proper precaution for preventing this, is to let down a light first,
which so long as it refuses to burn, is significant of danger.
Wine-lees, in an unrinsed<a id="FNanchor_2968_2968"></a><a href="#Footnote_2968_2968" class="fnanchor">2968</a> state, form an ingredient in several
medicinal preparations: with an equal proportion of iris,<a id="FNanchor_2969_2969"></a><a href="#Footnote_2969_2969" class="fnanchor">2969</a> a
liniment is prepared from them for purulent eruptions; and,
either moist or dried, they are used for stings inflicted by the
phalangium, and for inflammations<a id="FNanchor_2970_2970"></a><a href="#Footnote_2970_2970" class="fnanchor">2970</a> of the testes, mamill&aelig;,
or other parts of the body. A decoction of wine-lees is prepared,
too, with barley-meal and powdered frankincense; after
which it is first parched and then dried. The test of its being
properly boiled, is its imparting, when cold, a burning sensation
to the tongue. When left exposed to the air, wine-lees
very rapidly lose their virtues; which, on the other hand, are
greatly heightened by the action of fire.</p>

<p>Wine-lees are very useful, too, boiled with figs, for the cure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">483</a></span>
of lichens and cutaneous eruptions; they are applied also in a
similar manner to leprous sores and running ulcers. Taken
in drink, they act as an antidote to the poison of fungi, and
more particularly if they are undiluted; boiled and then rinsed,
they are used in preparations for the eyes. They are employed
also topically for diseases of the testes and generative organs,
and are taken in wine for strangury. When wine-lees have
lost their strength, they are still useful for cleansing the body
and scouring clothes, in which case they act as a substitute
for gum acacia.<a id="FNanchor_2971_2971"></a><a href="#Footnote_2971_2971" class="fnanchor">2971</a></p>

<p>The lees of vinegar,<a id="FNanchor_2972_2972"></a><a href="#Footnote_2972_2972" class="fnanchor">2972</a> as a matter of course, considering the
material from which they are derived, are much more acrid
than those of wine, and more caustic in their effects. This
substance prevents the increase of suppuration, and, employed
topically, is good for the stomach, intestines, and regions of
the abdomen. It has the property also of arresting fluxes of
those parts, and the catamenia when in excess; it disperses
inflamed tumours which have not come to a head, and is a cure
for quinsy. Applied with wax, it is curative of erysipelas.
It reduces swellings of the mamill&aelig; when gorged with milk,
and removes malformed nails. Employed with polenta, it is
very efficacious for the cure of stings inflicted by the serpent
called cerastes;<a id="FNanchor_2973_2973"></a><a href="#Footnote_2973_2973" class="fnanchor">2973</a> and in combination with melanthium,<a id="FNanchor_2974_2974"></a><a href="#Footnote_2974_2974" class="fnanchor">2974</a> it
heals bites inflicted by crocodiles and dogs.</p>

the best plan to employ with them the down that grows on

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_34"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 34. (3.)—THE LEAVES OF THE OLIVE: TWENTY-THREE
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The next rank, after the vine, clearly belongs to the olive.
The leaves of the olive-tree are astringent,<a id="FNanchor_2978_2978"></a><a href="#Footnote_2978_2978" class="fnanchor">2978</a> detergent, and
binding in the highest degree. Chewed and applied to sores,
they are of a healing nature; and applied topically with oil,
they are good for head-ache. A decoction of them with honey
makes a good liniment for such parts of the body as have been
subjected to cauterization, as also for inflammations of the gums,
whitlows, and foul and putrid ulcers: combined with honey,
they arrest discharges of blood from the nervous<a id="FNanchor_2979_2979"></a><a href="#Footnote_2979_2979" class="fnanchor">2979</a> parts of the a
body. The juice of olive leaves is efficacious for carbuncular
ulcers and pustules about the eyes, and for procidence of the
pupil; hence it is much employed in the composition of eye-salves,
having the additional property of healing inveterate
runnings of the eyes, and ulcerations of the eyelids.</p>

<p>This juice is extracted by pouring wine and rain-water
upon the leaves, and then pounding them; after which the
pulp is dried and divided into lozenges. Used with wool,
as a pessary, this preparation arrests menstruation when in
excess, and is very useful for the treatment of purulent sores,
condylomata, erysipelas, spreading ulcers, and epinyctis.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_35"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 35.—THE BLOSSOM OF THE OLIVE: FOUR REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The blossom,<a id="FNanchor_2980_2980"></a><a href="#Footnote_2980_2980" class="fnanchor">2980</a> too, of the olive-tree possesses similar properties.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span>
The young branches are burnt when just beginning
to blossom, and of the ashes a substitute for spodium<a id="FNanchor_2981_2981"></a><a href="#Footnote_2981_2981" class="fnanchor">2981</a> is
made, upon which wine is poured, and it is then burnt afresh.
To suppurations and inflamed tumours these ashes are applied, or
else the leaves, beaten up with honey; for the eyes, they are
used with polenta. The juice which exudes<a id="FNanchor_2982_2982"></a><a href="#Footnote_2982_2982" class="fnanchor">2982</a> from the wood,
when burnt in a green state, heals lichens, scaly eruptions, and
running ulcers.</p>

<p>As to the juice<a id="FNanchor_2983_2983"></a><a href="#Footnote_2983_2983" class="fnanchor">2983</a> which exudes naturally from the olive-tree,
and more particularly that of &AElig;thiopia, we cannot be
sufficiently surprised that authors should have been found to
recommend it as an application for tooth-ache, and to tell us
at the same time that it is a poison, and even that we must
have recourse to the wild olive for it. The bark of the roots
of the olive, as young and tender a tree as possible being
selected, scraped and taken every now and then in honey, is
good<a id="FNanchor_2984_2984"></a><a href="#Footnote_2984_2984" class="fnanchor">2984</a> for patients suffering from spitting of blood and purulent
expectorations. The ashes of the tree itself, mixed with
axle-grease, are useful for the cure of tumours, and heal
fistulas by the extraction of the vicious humours which they
contain.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_36"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 36.—WHITE OLIVES: FOUR REMEDIES. BLACK OLIVES:
THREE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>White olives are wholesome for the upper regions of the
stomach, but not so good for the bowels. Eaten by themselves,
habitually as a diet, quite fresh and before they are preserved,
they are remarkably serviceable, having the effect of
curing gravel,<a id="FNanchor_2985_2985"></a><a href="#Footnote_2985_2985" class="fnanchor">2985</a> and of strengthening the teeth when worn or
loosened by the use of meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span></p>

<p>Black olives, on the other hand, are not so wholesome for
the upper regions of the stomach, but are better for the
bowels; they are not good, however, for the head or for the
eyes. Both kinds, pounded and applied topically, are good
for the cure of burns, but the black olive is sometimes chewed
first, and instantly applied to the sore, for the purpose of preventing
blisters from forming. Colymbades<a id="FNanchor_2986_2986"></a><a href="#Footnote_2986_2986" class="fnanchor">2986</a> act as a detergent
for foul ulcers, but they are bad for persons suffering
from strangury.</p>

<p>As to the amurca of olives, we might appear to have said
enough on the subject already,<a id="FNanchor_2987_2987"></a><a href="#Footnote_2987_2987" class="fnanchor">2987</a> taking Cato as our guide; it
remains, however, to speak of the medicinal uses of this substance.
It is extremely serviceable as a strengthener of the
gums,<a id="FNanchor_2988_2988"></a><a href="#Footnote_2988_2988" class="fnanchor">2988</a> and for the cure of ulcers of the mouth; it has the
effect, also, of strengthening loose teeth in the sockets, and an
application of it is good for erysipelas and spreading ulcers.
For chilblains, the amurca of the black olive is the best, as
also as a fomentation for infants; that of the white olive is
used, with wool, as a pessary for affections of the uterus. Of
both kinds, however, the amurca is much more serviceable
when boiled; this being done in a vessel of Cyprian copper, to
the consistency of honey. Thus prepared, it is used, according
to the necessities of the case, with either vinegar, old
wine, or honied wine, for the treatment of maladies of the
mouth, teeth, and ears, and for running ulcers,<a id="FNanchor_2989_2989"></a><a href="#Footnote_2989_2989" class="fnanchor">2989</a> diseases of the
generative organs, and chaps on various parts of the body. It
is employed topically, for the cure of wounds, in a linen
pledget, and for sprains, in wool: as a medicament, it is of great
utility, more particularly when old, as in such case it effects
the cure of fistula.<a id="FNanchor_2990_2990"></a><a href="#Footnote_2990_2990" class="fnanchor">2990</a></p>

<p>It is used as an injection for ulcerations of the fundament,
the generative organs, and the uterus, and is employed topically
for incipient gout and diseases of the joints. Boiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>
down again, with omphacium,<a id="FNanchor_2991_2991"></a><a href="#Footnote_2991_2991" class="fnanchor">2991</a> to the consistency of honey,
it extracts decayed teeth; and, in combination with a decoction
of lupines and the plant cham&aelig;leon,<a id="FNanchor_2992_2992"></a><a href="#Footnote_2992_2992" class="fnanchor">2992</a> it is a marvellous

REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The leaves of the wild olive are possessed of similar properties.
The spodium<a id="FNanchor_2995_2995"></a><a href="#Footnote_2995_2995" class="fnanchor">2995</a> that is made by burning the young
branches is of remarkable efficacy for arresting fluxes; it
allays inflammations of the eyes also, acts as a detergent upon
ulcerous sores, makes the flesh grow on wounds from which it
has been removed, and acts gently as a caustic upon fleshy
excrescences, drying them up and making them cicatrize. The
rest of its properties are similar to those of the cultivated olive.
There is, however, one peculiarity in it; the leaves, boiled
with honey, are given in doses of a spoonful for spitting of
blood.<a id="FNanchor_2996_2996"></a><a href="#Footnote_2996_2996" class="fnanchor">2996</a> The oil, too, of the wild olive is more acrid, and
possesses greater energy than that of the cultivated olive;
hence it is that it is usual to rinse the mouth with it for the
purpose of strengthening the teeth.<a id="FNanchor_2997_2997"></a><a href="#Footnote_2997_2997" class="fnanchor">2997</a></p>

<p>The leaves, too, are applied topically, with wine, to whitlows,
carbuncles, and all kinds of gatherings; and, with
honey, to sores which require a detergent. Both a decoction
of the leaves and the natural juices of the wild olive form
ingredients in medicaments for the eyes; and the latter are
found useful as an injection for the ears, in the case of purulent
discharges even. From the blossom of the wild olive a
liniment is prepared for condylomata and epinyctis: it is applied
also to the abdomen, with barley-meal, for fluxes, and to
the head, with oil, for head-ache. In cases where the scalp
becomes detached from the cranium, the young branches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">488</a></span>
boiled and applied with honey, have a healing effect. These
branches, too, when arrived at maturity, taken with the food,
arrest diarrhœa: parched and beaten up with honey, they
act as a detergent upon corroding sores, and bring carbuncles
to a head and dispers them.</p>

of all is omphacium,<a id="FNanchor_2999_2999"></a><a href="#Footnote_2999_2999" class="fnanchor">2999</a> and next to that, green oil;<a id="FNanchor_3000_3000"></a><a href="#Footnote_3000_3000" class="fnanchor">3000</a> in addition
to which, we may remark that oil ought to be as fresh as
possible, except in cases where old oil is absolutely required.
For medicinal purposes, too, oil should be extremely fluid,
have an agreeable smell, and be free from<a id="FNanchor_3001_3001"></a><a href="#Footnote_3001_3001" class="fnanchor">3001</a> all taste, just the
converse, in fact, of the property which we look for in food.
Omphacium is good for the gums, and if kept from time to
time in the mouth, there is nothing better as a preservative of
the whiteness of the teeth. It checks profuse perspirations.</p>

<p>Oil of œnanthe<a id="FNanchor_3002_3002"></a><a href="#Footnote_3002_3002" class="fnanchor">3002</a> has just the same properties as oil of roses.
Like oil in general, it makes the body supple, and imparts to
it strength and vigour; it is injurious to the stomach, promotes
the increase of ulcers, irritates the fauces, and deadens
the effect of all poisons, white-lead and gypsum in particular,
if taken in hydromel or a decoction of dried figs. Taken with
water, it is good as an antidote to the effects of opium, and to
injuries inflicted by cantharides, the buprestis, the salamandra,
and the pine caterpillar.<a id="FNanchor_3003_3003"></a><a href="#Footnote_3003_3003" class="fnanchor">3003</a> Taken pure as an emetic, it is

and for fits of shivering from cold. Taken warm, in doses of
six cyathi, and more particularly when boiled with rue,<a id="FNanchor_3004_3004"></a><a href="#Footnote_3004_3004" class="fnanchor">3004</a> it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">489</a></span>

else with barley water,<a id="FNanchor_3005_3005"></a><a href="#Footnote_3005_3005" class="fnanchor">3005</a> it acts as a purgative upon the bowels.
It is useful, also, in the composition of plasters for wounds,
and it cleanses the complexion of the face. Injected into the
nostrils of oxen, till it produces eructation, it cures attacks of
flatulency.</p>

<p>When old it is of a more warming nature than when new,
and acts more energetically as a sudorific, and as a resolvent

it contributes in some degree to the improvement of the sight.
It is a remedy, also for head-ache; and, in combination with
water, for the burning attacks in fevers. If old oil should
happen not to be at hand, the new oil is boiled to act as a substitute
for it.</p>

the light, however, that is produced by the oil is very dim, in
consequence of its extreme thickness. The leaves are applied
topically with vinegar for erysipelas, and fresh-gathered, they
are used by themselves for diseases of the mamill&aelig; and defluxions;
a decoction of them in wine, with polenta and saffron,
is good for inflammations of various kinds. Boiled by

unwholesome<a id="FNanchor_3061_3061"></a><a href="#Footnote_3061_3061" class="fnanchor">3061</a> to the stomach, disturb the bowels, contract the
bladder, and act injuriously upon the nerves; when cooked,
however, they are of a more harmless nature. Quinces are
more pleasant eating when cooked; still however, eaten
raw, provided they are ripe, they are very useful<a id="FNanchor_3062_3062"></a><a href="#Footnote_3062_3062" class="fnanchor">3062</a> for spitting
of blood, dysentery, cholera, and cœliac affections; indeed,
they are not of the same efficacy when cooked, as they then
lose the astringent properties which belong to their juice.
They are applied also to the breast in the burning attacks of
fever, and, in spite of what has been stated above, they are
occasionally boiled in rain-water for the various purposes before-mentioned.
For pains in the stomach they are applied<a id="FNanchor_3063_3063"></a><a href="#Footnote_3063_3063" class="fnanchor">3063</a>
like a cerate, either raw or boiled. The down upon them
heals<a id="FNanchor_3064_3064"></a><a href="#Footnote_3064_3064" class="fnanchor">3064</a> carbuncles.</p>

<p>Boiled in wine, and applied with wax, they restore the hair,
when it has been lost by alopecy. A conserve of raw quinces
in honey relaxes the bowels: and they add very materially to
the sweetness of the honey, and render it more wholesome to
the stomach. Boiled quinces preserved in honey are beaten
up with a decoction of rose-leaves, and are taken as food by some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>
for the cure of affections of the stomach. The juice of raw quinces
is very good, also, for the spleen, hardness of breathing, dropsy,
affections of the mamill&aelig;, condylomata, and varicose veins.
The blossoms, either fresh or dried, are useful for inflammations
of the eyes, spitting of blood, and irregularities of the
catamenia. By beating them up with sweet wine, a soothing
sirop is prepared, which is very beneficial for cœliac
affections and diseases of the liver: with a decoction of them
a fomentation is made for procidence of the uterus and intestines.</p>

<p>From quinces an oil is also extracted, which we have spoken
of under the name of “melinum:”<a id="FNanchor_3065_3065"></a><a href="#Footnote_3065_3065" class="fnanchor">3065</a> in order to make it, the
fruit must not have been grown in a damp soil; hence it is
that the quinces which come from Sicily are so highly esteemed
for the purpose; while, on the other hand, the strutheum,<a id="FNanchor_3066_3066"></a><a href="#Footnote_3066_3066" class="fnanchor">3066</a>
though of a kindred kind, is not so good.</p>

<p>A circle<a id="FNanchor_3067_3067"></a><a href="#Footnote_3067_3067" class="fnanchor">3067</a> is traced round the root of this tree, and the root
itself is then pulled up with the left hand, care being taken
by the person who does so to state at the same moment the
object for which it is so pulled up, and for whom. Worn as
an amulet, this root is a cure for scrofula.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_57"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 57.—PUNIC APPLES OR POMEGRANATES: TWENTY-SIX
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>It would be a mere loss of time to recapitulate the nine<a id="FNanchor_3074_3074"></a><a href="#Footnote_3074_3074" class="fnanchor">3074</a>
different varieties of the pomegranate. The sweet pomegranates,
or, in other words, those known by the name of
“apyrena,”<a id="FNanchor_3075_3075"></a><a href="#Footnote_3075_3075" class="fnanchor">3075</a> are generally considered to be injurious to the
stomach; they are productive, also, of flatulency, and are bad
for the teeth and gums. The kind which closely resembles the
last in flavour, and which we have spoken of as the “vinous”
pomegranate, has very diminutive pips, and is thought to be
somewhat more wholesome than the others. They have an
astringent effect upon the stomach and bowels, provided they
are taken in moderation, and not to satiety; but even these,
or, indeed, any other kind, should never be given in fevers, as
neither the substance nor the juice of the fruit acts otherwise
than injuriously under those circumstances. They should,
also, be equally<a id="FNanchor_3076_3076"></a><a href="#Footnote_3076_3076" class="fnanchor">3076</a> abstained from in cases of vomiting and
bilious evacuations.</p>

<p>In this fruit Nature has revealed to us a grape, and, so to
say, not must, but a wine ready made, both grape and wine
being enclosed in a tougher skin.<a id="FNanchor_3077_3077"></a><a href="#Footnote_3077_3077" class="fnanchor">3077</a> The rind of the sour
pomegranate is employed for many purposes. It is in very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>
common use with curriers for tanning<a id="FNanchor_3078_3078"></a><a href="#Footnote_3078_3078" class="fnanchor">3078</a> leather, from which circumstance
it has received the name of “malicorium.”<a id="FNanchor_3079_3079"></a><a href="#Footnote_3079_3079" class="fnanchor">3079</a> Medical
men assure us that the rind is diuretic, and that, boiled
with nut-galls in vinegar, it strengthens loose teeth in the
sockets. It is prescribed also for pregnant women when suffering
from qualmishness, the flavour of it quickening the
fœtus. A pomegranate is cut, and left to soak in rain-water
for some three days; after which the infusion is given cold to
persons suffering from cœliac affections and spitting of blood.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_58"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 58.—THE COMPOSITION CALLED STOMATICE: FOURTEEN
REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>With the sour pomegranate a medicament is made, which is
known as “stomatice,” and is extremely good for affections of
the mouth, nostrils, and ears, dimness of sight, films upon the
eyes,<a id="FNanchor_3080_3080"></a><a href="#Footnote_3080_3080" class="fnanchor">3080</a> diseases of the generative organs, corrosive sores called
“nom&aelig;,” and fleshy excrescences in ulcers; it is useful, also,
as an antidote to the venom of the sea-hare.<a id="FNanchor_3081_3081"></a><a href="#Footnote_3081_3081" class="fnanchor">3081</a> The following
is the method of making it: the rind is taken off the fruit,
and the pips are pounded, after which the juice is boiled
down to one-third, and then mixed with saffron, split alum,<a id="FNanchor_3082_3082"></a><a href="#Footnote_3082_3082" class="fnanchor">3082</a>
myrrh, and Attic honey, the proportions being half a pound
of each.</p>

<p>Some persons have another way of making it: a number
of sour pomegranates are pounded, after which the juice is
boiled down in a new cauldron to the consistency of honey.
This composition is used for various affections of the generative
organs and fundament, and, indeed, all those diseases
which are treated with lycium.<a id="FNanchor_3083_3083"></a><a href="#Footnote_3083_3083" class="fnanchor">3083</a> It is employed, also, for
the cure of purulent discharges from the ears, incipient defluxions
of the eyes, and red spots upon the hands. Branches
of the pomegranate have the effect of repelling the attacks of
serpents.<a id="FNanchor_3084_3084"></a><a href="#Footnote_3084_3084" class="fnanchor">3084</a> Pomegranate rind, boiled in wine and applied, is

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_59"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 59.—CYTINUS: EIGHT REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Greeks have given the name of cytinus<a id="FNanchor_3086_3086"></a><a href="#Footnote_3086_3086" class="fnanchor">3086</a> to the first
germs of this tree when it is just beginning to blossom.
These germs have a singular property, which has been remarked
by many. If a person, after taking off everything
that is fastened upon the body, his girdle, for instance, shoes,
and even his ring, plucks one of them with two fingers of
the left hand, the thumb, namely, and the fourth finger, and,
after rubbing it gently round his eyes, puts it into his mouth
and swallows<a id="FNanchor_3087_3087"></a><a href="#Footnote_3087_3087" class="fnanchor">3087</a> it without letting it touch his teeth, he will
experience, it is said, no malady of the eyes throughout all
the year. These germs, dried and pounded, check the growth
of fleshy excrescences; they are good also for the gums and
teeth; and if the teeth are loose a decoction of the germs will
strengthen them.</p>

<p>The young pomegranates<a id="FNanchor_3088_3088"></a><a href="#Footnote_3088_3088" class="fnanchor">3088</a> themselves are beaten up and
applied as a liniment to spreading or putrid sores; they are
used also for inflammations of the eyes and intestines, and
nearly all the purposes for which pomegranate-rind is used.
They are remedial also for the stings of scorpions.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_60"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 60.—BALAUSTIUM: TWELVE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>We cannot sufficiently admire the care and diligence displayed
by the ancients, who, in their enquiries into every
subject, have left nothing untried. Within the cytinus, before
the pomegranate itself makes its appearance, there are diminutive
flowers, the name given to which, as already<a id="FNanchor_3089_3089"></a><a href="#Footnote_3089_3089" class="fnanchor">3089</a> stated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>
is “balaustium.”<a id="FNanchor_3090_3090"></a><a href="#Footnote_3090_3090" class="fnanchor">3090</a> These blossoms, even, have not escaped
their enquiries; it having been ascertained by them that they
are an excellent remedy for stings inflicted by the scorpion.
Taken in drink, they arrest the catamenia, and are curative
of ulcers of the mouth, tonsillary glands, and uvula, as also of
spitting of blood, derangement of the stomach and bowels,
diseases of the generative organs, and running sores in all
parts of the body.</p>

<p>The ancients also dried these blossoms, to try their efficacy
in that state, and made the discovery that, pulverized, they
cure patients suffering from dysentery when at the very point
of death even, and that they arrest looseness of the bowels.
They have not disdained, too, to make trial of the pips of the
pomegranate: parched and then pounded, these pips are good
for the stomach, sprinkled in the food or drink. To arrest
looseness of the bowels, they are taken in rain-water. A
decoction of the juices of the root, in doses of one victoriatus,<a id="FNanchor_3091_3091"></a><a href="#Footnote_3091_3091" class="fnanchor">3091</a>
exterminates tape-worm;<a id="FNanchor_3092_3092"></a><a href="#Footnote_3092_3092" class="fnanchor">3092</a> and the root itself, boiled
down in water to a thick consistency, is employed for the
same purposes as lycium.<a id="FNanchor_3093_3093"></a><a href="#Footnote_3093_3093" class="fnanchor">3093</a></p>

<p>There is a tree, also, which is called the wild pomegranate,<a id="FNanchor_3094_3094"></a><a href="#Footnote_3094_3094" class="fnanchor">3094</a>
on account of its strong resemblance to the cultivated pomegranate.
The roots of it have a red bark, which taken in
wine in doses of one denarius, promotes sleep. The seed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>

<p>All kinds of pears, as an aliment, are indigestible,<a id="FNanchor_3095_3095"></a><a href="#Footnote_3095_3095" class="fnanchor">3095</a> to
persons in robust health, even; but to invalids they are forbidden
as rigidly as wine. Boiled, however, they are remarkably
agreeable and wholesome, those of Crustumium<a id="FNanchor_3096_3096"></a><a href="#Footnote_3096_3096" class="fnanchor">3096</a>
in particular. All kinds of pears, too, boiled with honey, are
wholesome to the stomach. Cataplasms of a resolvent nature
are made with pears, and a decoction of them is used to disperse
indurations. They are efficacious, also, in cases of poisoning<a id="FNanchor_3097_3097"></a><a href="#Footnote_3097_3097" class="fnanchor">3097</a>
by mushrooms and fungi, as much by reason of their
heaviness, as by the neutralizing effects of their juice.</p>

<p>The wild pear ripens but very slowly. Cut in slices and
hung in the air to dry, it arrests looseness of the bowels,
an effect which is equally produced by a decoction of it taken
in drink; in which case the leaves also are boiled up together
with the fruit. The ashes of pear-tree wood are even more
efficacious<a id="FNanchor_3098_3098"></a><a href="#Footnote_3098_3098" class="fnanchor">3098</a> as an antidote to the poison of fungi.</p>

<p>A load of apples or pears, however small, is singularly
fatiguing<a id="FNanchor_3099_3099"></a><a href="#Footnote_3099_3099" class="fnanchor">3099</a> to beasts of burden; the best plan to counteract
this, they say, is to give the animals some to eat, or at least
to shew them the fruit before starting.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_63"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 63.—FIGS: ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN OBSERVATIONS

<p>The milky juice of the fig-tree possesses kindred properties
with vinegar;<a id="FNanchor_3100_3100"></a><a href="#Footnote_3100_3100" class="fnanchor">3100</a> hence it is, that, like rennet, it curdles milk.
This juice is collected before the fruit ripens, and dried in the
shade; being used with yolk of egg as a liniment, or else in
drink, with amylum,<a id="FNanchor_3101_3101"></a><a href="#Footnote_3101_3101" class="fnanchor">3101</a> to bring ulcers to a head and break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">503</a></span>
them, and for the purposes of an emmenagogue. With meal
of fenugreek and vinegar, it is applied topically for gout; it
acts also as a depilatory,<a id="FNanchor_3102_3102"></a><a href="#Footnote_3102_3102" class="fnanchor">3102</a> heals eruptions of the eyelids,
lichens and itch-scabs, and relaxes the bowels. The milk of
the fig-tree is naturally curative of the stings of hornets,
wasps, and similar insects, and is remarkably useful for wounds
inflicted by scorpions. Mixed with axle-grease it removes
warts. With the leaves and figs still green an application is
made for scrofulous<a id="FNanchor_3103_3103"></a><a href="#Footnote_3103_3103" class="fnanchor">3103</a> and other sores of a nature which requires
emollients or resolvents. The leaves, too, used by themselves,
are productive of a similar effect. In addition to this, they
are employed for other purposes, as a friction for lichens, for
example, for alopecy, and other diseases which require caustic
applications. The young shoots of the branches are used as
an application to the skin in cases of bites inflicted by dogs.
With honey they are applied to the ulcers known as honeycomb
ulcers;<a id="FNanchor_3104_3104"></a><a href="#Footnote_3104_3104" class="fnanchor">3104</a> mixed with the leaves of wild poppies they extract<a id="FNanchor_3105_3105"></a><a href="#Footnote_3105_3105" class="fnanchor">3105</a>
splinters of bones; and the leaves beaten up in vinegar
are a cure for bites inflicted by dogs. The young white shoots
of the black<a id="FNanchor_3106_3106"></a><a href="#Footnote_3106_3106" class="fnanchor">3106</a> fig are applied topically, with wax, to boils, and
bites inflicted by the shrew-mouse: and the ashes of their
leaves are used for the cure of gangrenes and the reduction of
fleshy excrescences.</p>

<p>Ripe figs are diuretic and laxative; they promote the perspiration,
and bring out pimples; hence it is that they are unwholesome
in autumn, the perspirations which they excite
being always attended with shivering. They are injurious
also to the stomach, though for a short time only; and it is
generally thought that they spoil the voice. The figs which
are the last to ripen are more wholesome than the first, but
those which are drugged<a id="FNanchor_3107_3107"></a><a href="#Footnote_3107_3107" class="fnanchor">3107</a> for the purpose of ripening them
are never wholesome. This fruit invigorates the young, and
improves the health of the aged and retards the formation of
wrinkles; it allays thirst, and is of a cooling nature, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>
which reason it should never be declined in those fevers of an
astringent tendency which are known as “stegn&aelig;.”</p>

<p>Dried figs are injurious to the stomach,<a id="FNanchor_3108_3108"></a><a href="#Footnote_3108_3108" class="fnanchor">3108</a> but are beneficial
in a marvellous degree to the throat and fauces. They are of
a warming nature, are productive of thirst, and relax the bowels,
but are unwholesome in stomachic complaints and fluxes of the
bowels. In all cases they are beneficial for the bladder, hardness
of breathing, and asthma, as also for diseases of the liver,
kidneys, and spleen. They are nourishing and invigorating,
for which reason, the athletes in former times used them as
food: Pythagoras, the gymnast, being the first who introduced
among them a flesh diet.<a id="FNanchor_3109_3109"></a><a href="#Footnote_3109_3109" class="fnanchor">3109</a> Figs are extremely useful
for patients recovering from a long illness, and for persons
suffering from epilepsy or dropsy. They are applied topically
also in all cases where sores require to be brought to a head,
or dispersed; and they are still more efficacious when mixed
with lime or nitre. Boiled with hyssop they act as a purgative
on the pectoral organs, carry off the phlegm, and cure
inveterate coughs: boiled with wine they heal maladies of
the fundament, and tumours of the jaws. A decoction of them
is applied also to boils, inflamed tumours, and imposthumes
of the parotid glands. This decoction, too, is found very
useful as a fomentation for disorders incident to females.</p>

<p>Boiled with fenugreek,<a id="FNanchor_3110_3110"></a><a href="#Footnote_3110_3110" class="fnanchor">3110</a> figs are very useful in cases of
pleurisy and peripneumony. A decoction of them with
rue is good for griping pains in the bowels; in combination
with verdigris,<a id="FNanchor_3111_3111"></a><a href="#Footnote_3111_3111" class="fnanchor">3111</a> they are used for ulcers of the legs and imposthumes
of the parotid glands; with pomegranates, for hang-nails;<a id="FNanchor_3112_3112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3112_3112" class="fnanchor">3112</a>
and with wax, for burns and chilblains. Boiled in
wine, with wormwood and barley-meal, they are employed
for dropsy. Eaten with nitre, they relax the bowels; and
beaten up with salt they are applied to stings inflicted by
scorpions. Boiled in wine, and applied topically, they bring
carbuncles to a head. In cases of carcinoma, unattended with
ulceration, it is a singularly good plan to apply to the part the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">505</a></span>
pulpiest fig that can be procured; the same, too, with phaged&aelig;nic
sores.</p>

<p>As to the ashes of the fig, those of no tree known are of a
more acrid character,<a id="FNanchor_3113_3113"></a><a href="#Footnote_3113_3113" class="fnanchor">3113</a> being of a detergent and astringent
nature, and tending to make new flesh and to promote the
cicatrization of wounds. They are also taken in drink, for
the purpose of dissolving coagulated blood, as also for bruises,
falls with violence, ruptures, convulsions * * * * in
one cyathus respectively of water and oil. They are administered
also for tetanus and spasms, and are used either in a
potion, or as an injection for cœliac affections and dysentery.
Employed as a liniment with oil, they have a warming effect;
and kneaded into a paste with wax and rose-oil, they heal
burns, leaving the slightest scar only. Applied in oil, as a
liniment, they are a cure for weakness of sight, and are used
as a dentifrice in diseases of the teeth.</p>

<p>It is said, too, that if a patient draws downward a branch
of a fig-tree, and turns up his head and bites off some knot
or other of it, without being seen by any one, and then wears
it in a leather bag suspended by a string from his neck, it is a
certain cure for scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotid
glands. The bark of this tree, beaten up with oil, cures
ulcerations of the abdomen. Green figs, applied raw, with
the addition of nitre and meal, remove warts and wens.<a id="FNanchor_3114_3114"></a><a href="#Footnote_3114_3114" class="fnanchor">3114</a></p>

<p>The ashes of the suckers which spring from the roots are used
as a substitute for spodium.<a id="FNanchor_3115_3115"></a><a href="#Footnote_3115_3115" class="fnanchor">3115</a> Burnt over a second time and
incorporated with white lead, they are divided into cakes

eruptions.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_64"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 64.—THE WILD FIG: FORTY-TWO OBSERVATIONS UPON IT.</span></h3></div>

<p>The wild fig, again, is even more efficacious in its properties
than the cultivated one. It has not so large a proportion of
milky juice as the other: a slip of it put into milk has the
effect of curdling it and turning it into cheese. This juice,
collected and indurated by being subjected to pressure, imparts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>
a fine flavor<a id="FNanchor_3116_3116"></a><a href="#Footnote_3116_3116" class="fnanchor">3116</a> to meat, being steeped in vinegar for the
purpose, and then rubbed upon it. It is used also as an ingredient
in blisters, and taken internally it relaxes the bowels.
Used with amylum,<a id="FNanchor_3117_3117"></a><a href="#Footnote_3117_3117" class="fnanchor">3117</a> it opens the passages of the uterus, and
combined with the yolk of an egg it acts as an emmenagogue.
Mixed with meal of fenugreek it is applied topically for
gout, and is used for the dispersion of leprous sores, itch-scabs,
lichens, and freckles: it is an antidote also to the stings
of venomous animals, and to the bites of dogs. Applied to
the teeth in wool, or introduced into the cavity of a carious
tooth, this juice cures tooth-ache.<a id="FNanchor_3118_3118"></a><a href="#Footnote_3118_3118" class="fnanchor">3118</a> The young shoots and
the leaves, mixed with meal of fitches, act as an antidote to
the poison of marine animals, wine being added to the preparation.
In boiling beef a great saving of fire-wood may be
effected, by putting some of these shoots in the pot.<a id="FNanchor_3119_3119"></a><a href="#Footnote_3119_3119" class="fnanchor">3119</a></p>

<p>The figs in a green state, applied topically, soften and disperse
scrofulous sores and all kinds of gatherings, and the leaves, to
a certain extent, have a similar effect. The softer leaves are
applied with vinegar for the cure of running ulcers, epinyctis,
and scaly eruptions. With the leaves, mixed with honey, honeycomb
ulcers<a id="FNanchor_3120_3120"></a><a href="#Footnote_3120_3120" class="fnanchor">3120</a> are treated, and wounds inflicted by dogs; the
leaves are applied, too, fresh, with wine, to phaged&aelig;nic sores.
In combination with poppy-leaves, they extract splintered
bones. Wild figs, in a green state, employed as a fumigation,
dispel flatulency; and an infusion of them, used as a potion,
combats the deleterious effects of bullocks’ blood, white-lead,
and coagulated milk, taken internally. Boiled in water, and
employed as a cataplasm, they cure imposthumes of the parotid
glands. The shoots, or the green figs, gathered as young as
possible, are taken in wine for stings inflicted by scorpions.
The milky juice is also poured into the wound, and the leaves
are applied to it: the bite of the shrew-mouse is treated in a
similar manner. The ashes of the young branches are curative
of relaxations of the uvula; and the ashes of the tree itself,
mixed with honey, have the effect of healing chaps. A decoction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">507</a></span>
of the root, boiled in wine, is good for tooth-ache.
The winter wild fig, boiled in vinegar and pounded, is a cure
for impetigo: the branches are first barked for the purpose
and then scraped; these scrapings, which are as fine as sawdust,
being applied topically to the parts affected.</p>

<p>There is also one medicinal property of a marvellous nature
attributed to the wild fig: if a youth who has not arrived at
puberty breaks off a branch, and then with his teeth tears off
the bark swelling with the sap, the pith of this branch, we are
assured, attached as an amulet to the person before sunrise,
will prevent the formation of scrofulous sores. A branch of
this tree, attached to the neck of a bull, however furious, exercises
such a marvellous effect upon him as to restrain his
ferocity,<a id="FNanchor_3121_3121"></a><a href="#Footnote_3121_3121" class="fnanchor">3121</a> and render him quite immoveable.</p>

mostly five small stems: in appearance it resembles ocimum,
and bears a white flower, with a small, black, seed. Beaten up
with Attic honey, it is a cure for defluxions of the eyes. In
whatever way it is gathered, it yields a considerable abundance
of sweet, milky, juice. With the addition of a little
nitre, this plant is extremely useful for pains in the ears. The
leaves of it have the property of neutralizing poisons.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_70"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 70.—MULBERRIES: THIRTY-NINE REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In Egypt and in the Isle of Cyprus there are, as already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">509</a></span>
stated,<a id="FNanchor_3131_3131"></a><a href="#Footnote_3131_3131" class="fnanchor">3131</a> mulberry-trees of a peculiar kind, being of a nature
that is truly marvellous; for, if the outer bark is peeled off,
they emit a great abundance of juice; but if a deeper incision
is made, they are found to be quite dry.<a id="FNanchor_3132_3132"></a><a href="#Footnote_3132_3132" class="fnanchor">3132</a> This juice is
an antidote to the venom of serpents, is good for dysentery,
disperses inflamed tumours and all kinds of gatherings, heals
wounds, and allays both head-ache and ear-ache: it is taken
in drink for affections of the spleen, and is used as a liniment
for the same purpose, as also for fits of shivering. This juice,
however, very soon breeds worms.</p>

<p>Among ourselves, too, the juice which exudes from the
mulberry-tree is employed for an equal number of purposes:
taken in wine, it neutralizes the noxious effects of aconite<a id="FNanchor_3133_3133"></a><a href="#Footnote_3133_3133" class="fnanchor">3133</a> and
the venom of spiders, relaxes the bowels, and expels tapeworm
and other animals which breed in the intestines;<a id="FNanchor_3134_3134"></a><a href="#Footnote_3134_3134" class="fnanchor">3134</a> the
bark of the tree, pounded, has also a similar effect. The
leaves, boiled in rain-water with the bark of the black fig and
the vine, are used for dyeing the hair.</p>

<p>The juice of the fruit has a laxative effect immediately upon
the bowels, though the fruit itself, for the moment, acts beneficially
upon the stomach, being of a refreshing nature, but productive
of thirst. If no other food is taken upon them, mulberries<a id="FNanchor_3135_3135"></a><a href="#Footnote_3135_3135" class="fnanchor">3135</a>
are of a swelling tendency. The juice of unripe mulberries
acts astringently upon the bowels. The marvels which
are presented by this tree, and of which we have made some
mention<a id="FNanchor_3136_3136"></a><a href="#Footnote_3136_3136" class="fnanchor">3136</a> when describing it, would almost appear to belong
to a creature gifted with animation.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_XXIII_CHAP_71"><span class="inblk">CHAP. 71.—THE MEDICAMENT CALLED STOMATICE, ARTERIACE, OR
PANCHRESTOS: FOUR REMEDIES.
</span></h3></div>
<p>From the fruit of the mulberry a medicament is prepared,
called “panchrestos,”<a id="FNanchor_3137_3137"></a><a href="#Footnote_3137_3137" class="fnanchor">3137</a> “stomatice,” or “arteriace:” the following
is the method employed. Three sextarii of the juice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">510</a></span>
are reduced, at a slow heat, to the consistency of honey; two
denarii of dried omphacium<a id="FNanchor_3138_3138"></a><a href="#Footnote_3138_3138" class="fnanchor">3138</a> or one of myrrh, with one denarius
of saffron, are then added, the whole being beaten up together
and mixed with the decoction. There is no medicament
known that is more soothing than this, for affections of
the mouth, the trachea, the uvula, and the stomach. There
is also another mode of preparing it: two sextarii of mulberry
juice and one of Attic honey are boiled down in the manner
above stated.</p>

<p>There are some other marvellous properties, also, which are
mentioned in reference to this tree. When the tree is in bud,
and before the appearance of the leaves, the germs of the fruit
must be gathered with the left hand—the Greeks give them
the name of “ricini.”<a id="FNanchor_3139_3139"></a><a href="#Footnote_3139_3139" class="fnanchor">3139</a> These germs, worn as an amulet
before they have touched the ground, have the effect of arresting
h&aelig;morrhage, whether proceeding from a wound, from the
mouth, from the nostrils, or from piles; for which purposes
they are, accordingly, put away and kept. Similar virtues
are attributed to a branch just beginning to bear, broken off at
full moon, provided also it has not touched the ground: this
branch, it is said, attached to the arm, is peculiarly efficacious
for the suppression of the catamenia when in excess. The
same effect is produced, it is said, when the woman herself
pulls it off, whatever time it may happen to be, care being
taken not to let it touch the ground, and to wear it attached to
the body. The leaves of the mulberry-tree beaten up fresh,
or a decoction of them dried, are applied topically for stings
inflicted by serpents: an infusion of them, taken in drink, is
equally efficacious for that purpose. The juice extracted from
the bark of the root, taken in wine or oxycrate, counteracts
the venom of the scorpion.</p>

<p>We must also give some account of the method of preparing
this medicament employed by the ancients: extracting the
juice from the fruit, both ripe and unripe, they mixed it together,
and then boiled it down in a copper vessel to the consistency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">511</a></span>
of honey. Some persons were in the habit of adding
myrrh and cypress, and then left it to harden in the sun, mixing
it with a spatula three times a-day. Such was their receipt for
the stomatice, which was also employed by them to promote
the cicatrization of wounds. There was another method, also,
of dealing with the juice of this fruit: extracting the juice,
they used the dried fruit with various articles of food,<a id="FNanchor_3140_3140"></a><a href="#Footnote_3140_3140" class="fnanchor">3140</a> as
tending to heighten the flavour; and they were in the habit
of employing it medicinally<a id="FNanchor_3141_3141"></a><a href="#Footnote_3141_3141" class="fnanchor">3141</a> for corroding ulcers, pituitous
expectorations, and all cases in which astringents were required
for the viscera. They used it also for the purpose of
cleaning<a id="FNanchor_3142_3142"></a><a href="#Footnote_3142_3142" class="fnanchor">3142</a> the teeth. A third mode of employing the juices of
this tree is to boil down the leaves and root, the decoction
being used, with oil,<a id="FNanchor_3143_3143"></a><a href="#Footnote_3143_3143" class="fnanchor">3143</a> as a liniment for the cure of burns.
The leaves are also applied by themselves for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>An incision made in the root at harvest-time, supplies a
juice that is extremely useful for tooth-ache, gatherings, and
suppurations; it acts, also, as a purgative upon the bowels.
Mulberry-leaves, macerated in urine, remove the hair from
hides.</p>

<p>Pine-nuts,<a id="FNanchor_3148_3148"></a><a href="#Footnote_3148_3148" class="fnanchor">3148</a> with the resin in them, are slightly bruised, and
then boiled down in water to one-half, the proportion of water
being one sextarius to each nut. This decoction, taken in
doses of two cyathi, is used for the cure of spitting of blood.
The bark of the tree, boiled in wine, is given for griping pains
in the bowels. The kernels of the pine-nut allay thirst, and
assuage acridities and gnawing pains in the stomach; they
tend also to neutralize vicious humours in that region, recruit
the strength, and are salutary to the kidneys and the bladder.
They would seem, however, to exercise an irritating effect<a id="FNanchor_3149_3149"></a><a href="#Footnote_3149_3149" class="fnanchor">3149</a>
upon the fauces, and to increase cough. Taken in water, wine,
raisin wine, or a decoction of dates, they carry off bile. For
gnawing pains in the stomach of extreme violence, they are
mixed with cucumber-seed and juice of purslain; they are employed,
too, in a similar manner for ulcerations of the bladder

are used topically for head-ache, when there is fever more particularly.
Should the head-ache proceed from inebriation,<a id="FNanchor_3154_3154"></a><a href="#Footnote_3154_3154" class="fnanchor">3154</a>

<p>Walnuts<a id="FNanchor_3164_3164"></a><a href="#Footnote_3164_3164" class="fnanchor">3164</a> have received their name in Greek from being
oppressive<a id="FNanchor_3165_3165"></a><a href="#Footnote_3165_3165" class="fnanchor">3165</a> to the head; for, in fact, the emanations<a id="FNanchor_3166_3166"></a><a href="#Footnote_3166_3166" class="fnanchor">3166</a> from the
tree itself and the leaves penetrate to the brain. The kernels,
also, have a similar effect when eaten, though not in so marked
a degree. When fresh gathered, they are most agreeable
eating; for when dry, they are more oleaginous, unwholesome
to the stomach, difficult of digestion, productive of head-ache,
and bad for cough,<a id="FNanchor_3167_3167"></a><a href="#Footnote_3167_3167" class="fnanchor">3167</a> or for a person when about to take an emetic
fasting: they are good in cases of tenesmus only, as they carry
off the pituitous humours of the body. Eaten beforehand, they
deaden the effects of poison, and, employed with rue and oil,
they are a cure for quinsy. They act as a corrective, also, to
onions, and modify their flavour. They are applied to inflammations
of the ears, with a little honey, and with rue they are
used for affections of the mamill&aelig;, and for sprains. With
onions, salt, and honey, they are applied to bites inflicted by
dogs or human beings. Walnut-shells are used for cauterizing<a id="FNanchor_3168_3168"></a><a href="#Footnote_3168_3168" class="fnanchor">3168</a>
carious teeth; and with these shells, burnt and then
beaten up in oil or wine, the heads of infants are anointed,
they having a tendency to make the hair grow; hence they
are used in a similar manner for alopecy also. These nuts,
eaten in considerable numbers, act as an expellent upon tapeworm.<a id="FNanchor_3169_3169"></a><a href="#Footnote_3169_3169" class="fnanchor">3169</a>

beaten up with polenta, are used for inflammations of the eyes,
with rue for inflammations of the testes, and with rose-oil, or
oil of iris,<a id="FNanchor_3192_3192"></a><a href="#Footnote_3192_3192" class="fnanchor">3192</a> for head-ache. Three leaves, chewed and swallowed
for three days in succession, are a cure for cough, and
beaten up with honey, for asthma. The bark of the root is
dangerous to pregnant women; the root itself disperses calculi,
and taken in doses of three oboli in aromatic wine, it
acts beneficially on the liver. The leaves, taken in drink, act
as an emetic;<a id="FNanchor_3193_3193"></a><a href="#Footnote_3193_3193" class="fnanchor">3193</a> and the berries, pounded and applied as a pessary,
or else taken in drink, promote menstruation. Two of
the berries with the skin removed, taken in wine, are a cure
for inveterate cough and hardness of breathing; if, however,
this is accompanied with fever, they are given in water, or
else in an electuary with raisin wine, or boiled in hydromel.
Employed in a similar manner, they are good for phthisis, and
for all defluxions of the chest, as they have the effect of
detaching the phlegm and bringing it off.</p>

<p>For stings inflicted by scorpions, four laurel-berries are
taken in wine. Applied with oil, they are a cure for epinyctis,
freckles, running sores, ulcers of the mouth, and scaly
eruptions. The juice of the berries is curative of porrigo
and phthiriasis; and for pains in the ears, or hardness of hearing,
it is injected into those organs with old wine and oil of
roses. All venomous creatures fly at the approach of persons
who have been anointed with this juice: taken in drink, the
juice of the small-leaved<a id="FNanchor_3194_3194"></a><a href="#Footnote_3194_3194" class="fnanchor">3194</a> laurel in particular, it is good for
stings inflicted by them. The berries,<a id="FNanchor_3195_3195"></a><a href="#Footnote_3195_3195" class="fnanchor">3195</a> used with wine, neutralize
the venom of serpents, scorpions, and spiders; they
are applied also, topically, with oil and vinegar, in diseases of
the spleen and liver, and with honey to gangrenous sores. In
cases of lassitude and shivering fits, it is a very good plan to
rub the body with juice of laurel-berries mixed with nitre.
Some persons are of opinion that delivery is accelerated by
taking laurel-root to the amount of one acetabulum, in water,
and that, used fresh, it is better than dried. It is recommended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">518</a></span>
by some authorities, to take ten of the berries in drink, for
the sting of the scorpion; and in cases of relaxation of the
uvula, to boil a quarter of a pound of the berries, or leaves,
in three sextarii of water, down to one third, the decoction
being used warm, as a gargle. For head-ache, also, it is recommended
to bruise an uneven number of the berries in oil,
the mixture being warmed for use.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Delphic laurel<a id="FNanchor_3196_3196"></a><a href="#Footnote_3196_3196" class="fnanchor">3196</a> bruised and applied to the
nostrils from time to time, are a preservative<a id="FNanchor_3197_3197"></a><a href="#Footnote_3197_3197" class="fnanchor">3197</a> against contagion
in pestilence, and more particularly if they are burnt.
The oil of the<a id="FNanchor_3198_3198"></a><a href="#Footnote_3198_3198" class="fnanchor">3198</a> Delphic laurel is employed in the preparation
of cerates and the medicinal composition known as “acopum,”<a id="FNanchor_3199_3199"></a><a href="#Footnote_3199_3199" class="fnanchor">3199</a>
and is used for fits of shivering occasioned by cold, for the
relaxation of the sinews, and for the cure of pains in the side
and the cold attacks in fevers.<a id="FNanchor_3200_3200"></a><a href="#Footnote_3200_3200" class="fnanchor">3200</a> Warmed in the rind of a
pomegranate, it is applied topically for the cure of ear-ache. A
decoction of the leaves boiled down in water to one third, used
as a gargle, braces the uvula, and taken in drink allays pains
in the bowels and intestines. The more tender leaves, bruised
in wine and applied at night, are a cure for pimples and
prurigo.</p>

<p>The other varieties of the laurel possess properties which
are nearly analogous. The root of the laurel of Alexandria,<a id="FNanchor_3201_3201"></a><a href="#Footnote_3201_3201" class="fnanchor">3201</a>
or of Mount Ida,<a id="FNanchor_3202_3202"></a><a href="#Footnote_3202_3202" class="fnanchor">3202</a> accelerates delivery, being administered in
doses of three denarii to three cyathi of sweet wine; it acts
also as an emmenagogue, and brings away the after-birth.
Taken in drink in a similar manner, the wild laurel, known as
“daphnoides” and by the other names which we have mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_3203_3203"></a><a href="#Footnote_3203_3203" class="fnanchor">3203</a>
is productive of beneficial effects. The leaves of it,
either fresh or dried, taken in doses of three drachm&aelig;, in
hydromel with salt, act as a purgative<a id="FNanchor_3204_3204"></a><a href="#Footnote_3204_3204" class="fnanchor">3204</a> upon the bowels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">519</a></span>
The wood, chewed, brings off phlegm, and the leaves act as
an “emetic;” they are unwholesome, however, to the stomach.
The berries, too, are sometimes taken, fifteen in number, as a
purgative.</p>

<p>The white<a id="FNanchor_3205_3205"></a><a href="#Footnote_3205_3205" class="fnanchor">3205</a> cultivated myrtle is employed for fewer medicinal
purposes than the black one.<a id="FNanchor_3206_3206"></a><a href="#Footnote_3206_3206" class="fnanchor">3206</a> The berries<a id="FNanchor_3207_3207"></a><a href="#Footnote_3207_3207" class="fnanchor">3207</a> of it are
good for spitting of blood, and taken in wine, they neutralize
the poison of fungi. They impart an agreeable smell<a id="FNanchor_3208_3208"></a><a href="#Footnote_3208_3208" class="fnanchor">3208</a> to the
breath, even when eaten the day before; thus, for instance, in
Menander we find the Synaristos&aelig;<a id="FNanchor_3209_3209"></a><a href="#Footnote_3209_3209" class="fnanchor">3209</a> eating them. They are
taken also for dysentery,<a id="FNanchor_3210_3210"></a><a href="#Footnote_3210_3210" class="fnanchor">3210</a> in doses of one denarius, in wine:
and they are employed lukewarm, in wine, for the cure of
obstinate ulcers on the extremities. Mixed with polenta, they
are employed topically in ophthalmia, and for the cardiac
disease<a id="FNanchor_3211_3211"></a><a href="#Footnote_3211_3211" class="fnanchor">3211</a> they are applied to the left breast. For stings inflicted
by scorpions, diseases of the bladder, head-ache, and
fistulas of the eye before suppuration, they are similarly employed;
and for tumours and pituitous eruptions, the kernels
are first removed and the berries are then pounded in old
wine. The juice of the berries<a id="FNanchor_3212_3212"></a><a href="#Footnote_3212_3212" class="fnanchor">3212</a> acts astringently upon the
bowels, and is diuretic: mixed with cerate it is applied topically
to blisters, pituitous eruptions, and wounds inflicted by
the phalangium; it imparts a black tint,<a id="FNanchor_3213_3213"></a><a href="#Footnote_3213_3213" class="fnanchor">3213</a> also, to the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">520</a></span></p>

<p>The oil of this myrtle is of a more soothing nature than the
juice, and the wine<a id="FNanchor_3214_3214"></a><a href="#Footnote_3214_3214" class="fnanchor">3214</a> which is extracted from it, and which
possesses the property of never inebriating, is even more so.
This wine, used when old, acts astringently upon the stomach
and bowels, cures griping pains in those regions, and dispels
nausea.</p>

<p>The dried leaves, powdered and sprinkled upon the body,
check profuse perspirations, in fever even; they are good, too,
used as a fomentation, for cœliac affections, procidence of the
uterus, diseases of the fundament, running ulcers, erysipelas,
loss of the hair, scaly and other eruptions, and burns. This
powder is used as an ingredient, also, in the plasters known as
“lipar&aelig;;”<a id="FNanchor_3215_3215"></a><a href="#Footnote_3215_3215" class="fnanchor">3215</a> and for the same reason the oil of the leaves is
used for a similar purpose, being extremely efficacious as an
application to the humid parts of the body, the mouth and the
uterus, for example.</p>

<p>The leaves themselves, beaten up with wine, neutralize<a id="FNanchor_3216_3216"></a><a href="#Footnote_3216_3216" class="fnanchor">3216</a> the
bad effects of fungi; and they are employed, in combination
with wax, for diseases of the joints, and gatherings. A decoction
of them, in wine, is taken for dysentery and dropsy.
Dried and reduced to powder, they are sprinkled upon ulcers
and h&aelig;morrhages. They are useful, also, for the removal of
freckles, and for the cure of hang-nails,<a id="FNanchor_3217_3217"></a><a href="#Footnote_3217_3217" class="fnanchor">3217</a> whitlows, condylomata,
affections of the testes, and sordid ulcers. In combination
with cerate, they are used for burns.</p>

<p>For purulent discharges from the ears, the ashes of the
leaves are employed, as well as the juice and the decoction:
the ashes are also used in the composition of antidotes. For a
similar purpose the blossoms are stripped from off the young
branches, which are burnt in a furnace, and then pounded in
wine. The ashes of the leaves, too, are used for the cure of
burns. To prevent ulcerations from causing swellings in the
inguinal glands, it will suffice for the patient to carry<a id="FNanchor_3218_3218"></a><a href="#Footnote_3218_3218" class="fnanchor">3218</a> a sprig
of myrtle about him which has never touched the ground or
any implement of iron.</p>

<p>We have already described the manner in which myrtidanum<a id="FNanchor_3219_3219"></a><a href="#Footnote_3219_3219" class="fnanchor">3219</a>
is made. Applied in a pessary, or as a fomentation or liniment,
it is good for affections of the uterus, being much more efficacious
than the bark of the tree, or the leaves and seed. There
is a juice also extracted from the more tender leaves, which
are pounded in a mortar for the purpose, astringent wine, or,
according to one method, rain-water, being poured upon them
a little at a time. This extract is used for the cure of ulcers of
the mouth, the fundament, the uterus, and the abdomen.
It is employed, also, for dyeing the hair black, the suppression
of exudations at the arm-pits,<a id="FNanchor_3220_3220"></a><a href="#Footnote_3220_3220" class="fnanchor">3220</a> the removal of freckles, and
other purposes in which astringents are required.</p>

OR CHAM&AElig;MYRSINE, AND THE RUSCUS: SIX REMEDIES.</span></h3></div>

<p>The wild myrtle, oxymyrsine,<a id="FNanchor_3221_3221"></a><a href="#Footnote_3221_3221" class="fnanchor">3221</a> or cham&aelig;myrsine, differs
from the cultivated myrtle in the redness of its berries and its
diminutive height. The root of it is held in high esteem; a
decoction of it, in wine, is taken for pains in the kidneys and
strangury, more particularly when the urine is thick and
fetid. Pounded in wine, it is employed for the cure of jaundice,
and as a purgative for the uterus. The same method is
adopted, also, with the young shoots, which are sometimes
roasted in hot ashes and eaten as a substitute for asparagus.<a id="FNanchor_3222_3222"></a><a href="#Footnote_3222_3222" class="fnanchor">3222</a></p>

<p>The berries, taken with wine, or oil and vinegar, break
calculi<a id="FNanchor_3223_3223"></a><a href="#Footnote_3223_3223" class="fnanchor">3223</a> of the bladder: beaten up with rose-oil and vinegar,
they allay head-ache. Taken in drink, they are curative of
jaundice. Castor calls the wild myrtle with prickly leaves,
or oxymyrsine, from which brooms are made, by the name of
“ruscus”<a id="FNanchor_3224_3224"></a><a href="#Footnote_3224_3224" class="fnanchor">3224</a>—the medicinal properties of it are just the same.</p>

sets heliacally <i>after</i> the Dog-star, though it rises before it. Hardouin observes,
that it is abundantly proved from the ancient writers that it was
the custom to sacrifice a puppy to Sirius, or the Dog-star, at the Robigalia.
As Littr&eacute; justly remarks, it would almost appear that Pliny intended, by

<p><a id="Footnote_886_886"></a><a href="#FNanchor_886_886"><span class="label">886</span></a> Possibly the Ferula asafœtida of Linn&aelig;us; or, according to some, the
Thapsia silphium of Viviani, <i>Flor. Lib.</i> It was a plant common, according
to ancient writers, to Syria, Armenia, Media, and Libya; but it was
the produce of this last country, probably, that afforded the juice or gum
resin here mentioned as “laser,” and so highly esteemed by the ancients, as
forming a component part of their perfumes. F&eacute;e is inclined to think
that the Laserpitium here spoken of was the Thapsia silphium, and to
reject the more general opinion that it is identical with the Ferula asafœtida.
Pliny has probably caused some confusion by blending the description
of other writers with that given by Theophrastus, each having
in view a different plant. Indeed, whatever the Laserpitium or Silphium
of other countries may have been, it is not improbable that the odoriferous
plant of Cyrenaica was not identical with the Ferula asafœtida of Linn&aelig;us.
The foliage of the Thapsia silphium is exactly similar to that of the
Laserpitium as depicted on medals of Cyrenaica, still extant. We learn
from Littr&eacute;, that Dr. Guyon showed, in 1842, to the Acad&eacute;mie des
Sciences, a plant which the Arabs of Algeria employ as a purgative, and
which they call <i>bonnefa</i>. It is the Thapsia Garganica of Desfontaines,
and is considered by Guyon to be identical with the Silphium of the
ancients.</p></div>

the nutritive qualities of plants are really based upon their medicinal virtues,
a point of view little regarded by the majority of mankind in his

their utility.</p></div>

identify this with the Digitalis purpurea, clown’s spikenard, or our Lady’s
gloves. The only strong objection to this is the fact that the root of the
digitalis has a very faint but disagreeable smell, and not at all like that of
cinnamon. But then, as F&eacute;e says, we have no positive proof that the
“cinnamomum” of the ancients is identical with our cinnamon. See Vol.
iii. p. 138. Sprengel takes the “bacchar” of Virgil to be the Valeriana
Celtica, and the “baccharis” of the Greeks to be the Gnaphalium sanguineum,
a plant of Egypt and Palestine. The bacchar has been also
identified with the Asperula odorata of Linn&aelig;us, the Geum urbanum of
Linn&aelig;us (the root of which has the smell of cloves), the Inula Vaillantii,
the Salvia Sclarea, and many other plants.</p></div>

Ajacis: Sprengel and Salmasius with the Gladiolus communis: Sibthorp
with the Gladiolus communis triphyllos: Dodon&aelig;us and Porta the Lilium
bulbiferum: and Martyn and F&eacute;e the Lilium Martagon of Linn&aelig;us, the
Turk’s-cap lily. From what Pliny says in cc. 39 and 97 of this Book,
and in B. xxv. c. 80, it is pretty clear that under the name of hyacinth he
has confused the characteristics of two different plants. The hyacinth,
too, of Dioscorides, B. iii. c. 5, is a different plant, F&eacute;e remarks, being
the Hyacinthus comosus of modern botanists.</p></div>

have been opium. The origin of the word is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νή</span>, “not,” and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένθος</span>,
“grief;” and, as F&eacute;e says, it would seem to indicate rather a composition
than a plant. Saffron, mandragore, nightshade, and even tea and coffee,
have been suggested by the active imaginations of various writers. F&eacute;e is
of opinion that it is impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion, but
inclines to the belief that either the poppy or a preparation from it, is
meant. In confirmation of this opinion, it is a singular fact, that, as Dr.
Paris remarks (in his Pharmacologia), the Nepenthes of Homer was obtained
from Thebes in Egypt, and that tincture of opium, or laudanum,
has received the name of “Thebaic tincture.” Gorr&aelig;us, in his “Definitiones
Medic&aelig;,” thinks that the herb alluded to is the Inula Campania,
or Elecampane, which was also said to have derived its name of
“Helenium” from Helen. Dr. Greenhill, in Smith’s Dictionary of Antiquities,
inclines to the opinion that it was opium. See the article
“Pharmaceutica.”</p></div>
